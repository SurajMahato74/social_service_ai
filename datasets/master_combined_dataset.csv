Click here प्रतिवेदन तयार पार्ने क्रममा ५२ प्रत्यक्षदर्शी, पीडित, पत्रकार, स्वास्थ्यकर्मी, राजनीतिज्ञ र सुरक्षा निकायसँग जोडिएको स्रोतसँग अन्तर्वार्ता गरिएको ह्युमन राइट्स वाचले जनाएको छ । ‘सामाजिक सञ्जालमा सार्वजनिक वा अनुसन्धानकर्तालाई दिइएका तस्बिर र भिडियो, अस्पताल एवं प्रदर्शन र आगजनी भएका स्थानहरूमा गरिएको स्थलगत अध्ययनबाट यो प्रतिवेदन तयार गरिएको हो,’ ह्युमन राइट्स वाचले भनेको छ, ‘यो अध्ययन काठमाडौंमा केन्द्रित थियो ।’ प्रत्यक्षदर्शीसँगको कुराकानी र विश्लेषण गरिएकाले फुटेजले २३ भदौमा प्रहरीलाई तत्काल वा केहीबेरमा खतरा हुने अवस्था नदेखिएकाले त्यो दिन घातक हतियार प्रयोगको औचित्य पुष्टि नहुने निष्कर्ष प्रतिवेदनले निकालेको छ । युवालाई तितरबितर पार्न प्रहरीले त्यो दिन दिउँसो १२:३० देखि ४ बजेसम्ममा घातक हतियार प्रयोग गरेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । ‘उनीहरूको टाउको, छाती र पेटमा गोली हानिएको छ,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ । ‘डिस्कर्ड’ सहितका सामाजिक सञ्जालमार्फत तयारी गरेर ९ बजेदेखि भेला हुन थालेका प्रदर्शनकारीको भीड ११ बजेसम्ममा ठूलो बनिसकेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । ‘प्रदर्शनकारी संसद् भवनतर्फ अगाडि बढ्दै जाँदा केहीले सडकको एकातर्फ रहेको ब्यारिकेड पार गरे,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘प्रहरीले उनीहरूलाई तितरबितर पार्न अश्रुग्यास, पानीका फोहोरा र लाठी प्रयोग गरे ।’ त्यस बेला ठूलो संख्यामा प्रदर्शनकारी संसद् भवनको मुख्य गेटमा भेला भइसकेका थिए भने केहीले प्रहरीतर्फ ढुंगा हानेका थिए । करिब १२:३० बजे सरकारले कर्फ्यु आदेश जारी गरेको थियो । तर त्यसबारे कुनै सूचना सरकारले नदिएको थाहा नपाएको अनुसन्धानकर्ताले कुरा गरेका प्रदर्शनकारी र पत्रकारले बताएका छन् । कर्फ्यु आदेश जारी भएको ५ मिनेटपछि नै प्रहरीले घातक हतियारबाट गोली चलाउन थालेको एक प्रहरी अधिकारीले जानकारी दिएका छन् । दिउँसो १ बजेसम्ममा परिस्थिति निकै बिग्रिसकेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । अन्तर्वार्ता गरिएका कुनै पनि प्रत्यक्षदर्शीले घातक हतियार प्रयोगअघि प्रहरीले चेतावनी दिएको थाहा नपाएको बताएका छन् । १:४० बजे २० वर्षीय विद्यार्थीको काँधमा गोली लाग्दासम्म शान्तिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन भइरहेको भनिएको छ । ‘सबै कुरा शान्त हुँदा प्रहरीले अचानक बिनाकारण गोली चलाउन थाल्यो,’ एक विद्यार्थीले भनेकी छन् । बेलुकी संसद् भवनभित्र रहेको स्पेसल टाक्स फोर्स (एसटीएफ) ले ३३ विद्यार्थीलाई संसद् भवनको चौरमा नियन्त्रणमा राखेको भनिएको छ । उनीहरूलाई कुटपिटसँगै धम्की दिइएको र बेलुकी छाडिएको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । प्रतिवेदनमा प्रहरीले अस्पताल परिसरमै प्रवेश गरेर लाठीचार्ज गरेको सन्दर्भ पनि उल्लेख छ । त्यस क्रममा कर्मचारीसमेत घाइते भएको भनिएको छ । अनुसन्धानकर्ताले अन्तर्वार्ता गरेका एक पूर्वप्रहरी वरिष्ठ अधिकारीले प्रदर्शन नियन्त्रण र प्राणघातक बल प्रयोगसम्बन्धी प्रक्रिया पालनामा प्रहरी असफल भएको टिप्पणी गरेका छन् । ‘संयुक्त राष्ट्रसंघको बल र घातक हतियार प्रयोगसम्बन्धी आधारभूत सिद्धान्तले मृत्यु वा गम्भीर चोटको आसन्न खतराबाहेक बन्दुक प्रयोग गर्न निषेध गर्छ,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘जीवन रक्षा गर्न पूर्ण रूपमा अपरिहार्य भएको अवस्थामा मात्र जानाजान प्राणघातक गोली चलाउन पाइन्छ ।’ नेपालको कानुनअनुसार पनि सुरक्षा संयन्त्रलाई घातक हतियार प्रयोग गर्न आदेश हुँदा पनि पूर्वचेतावनी र मृत्यु नहुने उपाय अपनाउनुपर्ने भनिएको छ । ‘विगतमा भएका मानवअधिकार उल्लंघनकर्तामा कायम रहेको दण्डहीनताले नै यस पटक नेपालमा हिंसालाई सम्भव बनायो, सरकारहरूले दशकौंसम्म छानबिन गर्ने र अभियोजन रोक्ने प्रवृत्तिलाई उल्टाउनु अत्यावश्यक छ,’ ह्युमन राइट्स वाचकी एसिया क्षेत्र उपनिर्देशक गांगुलीले भनेकी छन् । पहिलो दिनको बल प्रयोगको परिणाम दोस्रो दिन २३ भदौको भीडमा मुख्य गरी युवा प्रदर्शनकारी मात्र भए पनि दोस्रो दिनको हिंसा र आगजनीमा अन्य समूह रहेको प्रत्यक्षदर्शी र विश्लेषकको भनाइ प्रतिवेदनमा उद्धृत गरिएको छ । म्याग्दीको एक स्थानीय तहको ‘सिस्टम ह्याक’ गरेरसमेत प्रदर्शनका लागि उक्साउने सन्देश प्रवाह गरिएको पनि उल्लेख छ । ‘उक्त सन्देशमा निर्दोष बालबालिकाको रगत बगाउने नेताको रगत बगे मात्र नेपालमा शान्ति आउँछ भनिएको थियो,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ । व्यक्तिको सम्पत्तिमाथि आक्रमण गर्न उक्साउने वा निर्देशन दिने सामग्री सामाजिक सञ्जाल तथा ‘डिस्कर्ड’ मा फैलाइएको देखिएको प्रत्यक्षदर्शीको भनाइ र समाचारमा पनि पाइएको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । प्रदर्शनकारीले प्रहरी कार्यालयहरूमा समेत तोडफोड, आगजनी र हतियार लुटपाट गरेको भनिएको छ । त्यसक्रममा तीन प्रहरीको समेत कुटपिटबाट मृत्यु भयो । प्रतिवेदनअनुसार प्रहरी चौकीतर्फ पहिलो आक्रमण २४ भदौको ११:३४ मा हरिसिद्धिस्थित चौकीमा भएको थियो । बिहान ११ बजेतिर खुमलटारमा रहेको युलेन्स स्कुलमा आक्रमण भएको थियो । तीनकुनेस्थित कान्तिपुर टीभीको कार्यालयमा दिउँसो १:३० देखि २ बजेबीचमा १० देखि १५ जना लाठी, चक्कु र पेट्रोल बोकेर आएको भनिएको छ । उनीहरूले टेलिभिजनको कार्यालयमा तोडफोड र चार कर्मचारीमाथि कुटपिट गरेको भनिएको छ । ‘आक्रमणकारीले स्टुडियोबाहिर पार्क गरिएका सवारीसाधनमा आगजनी गरेर जलिरहेको एउटा स्कुटर भित्र धकेले, जसका कारण च्यानलको प्रसारण ७० घण्टासम्म बन्द हुन पुग्यो,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘अलग स्थानमा रहेको कान्तिपुर समूहका दुई ठूला दैनिक पत्रिकाको कार्यालय दिउँसो करिब १२:३० बजे खाली गराइयो । कर्मचारीहरूका अनुसार ३:३० देखि ४ बजेसम्ममा भीडले त्यस भवनमा आगजनी गरेको विश्वास गरिन्छ ।’ अन्नपूर्ण पोस्टको कार्यालयमा आगजनी गरिएको पनि प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । प्रत्यक्षदर्शीलाई उद्धृत गर्दै दिउँसो १२:३० देखि १ बजेबीचमा विभिन्न समूह सर्वोच्च अदालत, सिंहदरबारजस्ता महत्त्वपूर्ण सरकारी संरचना आसपास आउन सुरु गरेको भनिएको छ । सर्वोच्च अदालतभित्र २ देखि २:३० बजेबीचमा पुरुषहरू प्रवेश गरी ठूलो संख्यामा फाइल निकालेर पार्किङ क्षेत्रमा जलाएको भनिएको छ । त्यसको केही समयमा सर्वोच्च अदालतको भवनमा आगजनी भएको भनिएको छ । केही प्रत्यक्षदर्शीले आगजनीमा संलग्न समूहमा ‘बाइकर ग्याङ’ देखिएको बताएका छन् । ‘उनीहरूले खुकुरी र फलामको रड बोकेको भनिएको छ, एक प्रत्यक्षदर्शीले उनीहरूले मोटरसाइकलको पेट्रोल प्रयोग गरेर बम बनाई सिंहदरबारको मुख्य भवनमा आगो लगाएको देखेको भनेका छन्,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘धेरै व्यवसायी र व्यापारीहरूको घरमाथि आक्रमण भयो तर छिमेकीका उस्तै व्यवसायका सम्पत्तिहरू भने जोगिएका थिए ।’ अपराह्न ४:२५ बजे राष्ट्रपति भवन, शीतलनिवासमा आगो लागेको भनिएको छ । गेटमा सानो संख्यामा उपस्थित सैनिकले उनीहरूको प्रवेश रोक्न नसकेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । ‘एक प्रत्यक्षदर्शीले प्रधानमन्त्रीको सरकारी निवास बालुवाटारमा आगो लागेका बेला आफू त्यहाँ उपस्थित भएको बताएका थिए, बालुवाटारमा खटिएका प्रहरीले हामी तपाईंमाथि गोली चलाउँदैनौं भनेको उनले उल्लेख गरेका छन्,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘१०–१५ मिनेटपछि गेट खोलिदिए ।’ राष्ट्रिय मानवअधिकार आयोगका पूर्वसदस्य सुदीप पाठक ह्युमन राइट्स वाचको प्रतिवेदन कार्यान्वयनको विषय सरकारका लागि बाध्यकारी नभए पनि अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय जगत्मा सन्देश जाने भएकाले नैतिक रूपमा चुप लागेर बस्न नमिल्ने बताउँछन् । ‘लोकतान्त्रिक मुलुकले यसलाई आधार मानेर थप प्रक्रिया अघि बढाउन सक्छ, यसमा उल्लिखित विषयलाई छानबिनको मामिला बनाउन सक्छ,’ उनी भन्छन्, ‘यो एउटा फगत प्रतिवेदन हो भनेर राज्य चुप लागेर बस्यो भने त्यसले कालान्तरमा राम्रो गर्दैन ।’ सरकारले २३ र २४ भदौका घटना जाँचबुझका लागि पूर्वन्यायाधीश गौरीबहादुर कार्कीको अध्यक्षतामा उच्चस्तरीय आयोग गठन गरेको छ । आयोगले प्रतिवेदन दिएपछि मात्रै दोषीमाथि कारबाही प्रक्रिया अघि बढाउने सरकारको तयारी छ । आयोगले जाँचबुझ गर्न थालेको दुई महिना पूरा गरेको छ । कार्यकाल एक महिना मात्र बाँकी रहेको आयोगले सम्बन्धित व्यक्तिहरूसँग बयान र घटनासम्बन्धी विवरण संकलन गरिरहेको छ । अहिलेसम्म ६० प्रतिशतभन्दा बढी काम सकिएको दाबी गर्दै आयोगले केहीको बयान सकिएपछि नै प्रतिवेदन लेखन सुरु हुने जानकारी दिएको छ । राष्ट्रिय मानवअधिकार आयोगले पनि जेन–जी आन्दोलनबारे अनुसन्धान गरिरहेको छ । आयोगकी सदस्य लिली थापाको नेतृत्वमा गठित समितिले आन्दोलनमा राज्य पक्षबाट भएका मानवअधिकार उल्लंघनबारे अनुसन्धान गरिरहेको हो । आयोगका प्रवक्ता टीकाराम पोखरेलका अनुसार समितिले २३ र २४ भदौमा खटिएका कर्मचारीहरूको बयान लिइरहेको छ । ‘आयोगको टोलीले काठमाडौंबाहिरका ठाउँहरूमा समेत स्थलगत अध्ययन गरेको छ, पूर्ण प्रतिवेदन एकै पटक निकाल्ने तयारी छ,’ उनले भने, ‘प्रतिवेदन चाँडै सार्वजनिक गर्नुपर्छ भन्नेमा आयोग दृढ छ ।’","‘घातक हतियार प्रयोगमा संलग्न सुरक्षा अधिकारी र राजनीतिक पात्रलाई जवाफदेही बनाऊ’ Facebook Messenger Whatsapp Viber Twiter Copy Link What you should know : काठमाडौँ — मानवअधिकार उल्लंघनका घटनाबारे विश्वव्यापी अनुगमन गर्ने संस्था ‘ह्युमन राइट्स वाच’ ले नेपालको जेन–जी आन्दोलनमा प्रहरीले घातक हतियारसहित अत्यधिक बल प्रयोग गरेको निष्कर्ष निकालेको छ । बल प्रयोगमा संलग्न सुरक्षा निकाय र राजनीतिक पात्रहरूलाई जवाफदेही बनाउन ह्युमन राइट्स वाचले सुझाव दिएको छ । आइतबार सार्वजनिक भएको प्रतिवेदनमा २३ भदौको जेन–जी आन्दोलनमा प्रहरीले तीन घण्टासम्म जथाभावी गोली प्रहार गरेको उल्लेख छ । त्यो दिन राज्यबाट व्यापक दमन भएपछि मानिस अर्को दिन विरोध गर्दै सडकमा उत्रिएको ह्युमन राइट्स वाचको निष्कर्ष छ । २४ भदौका तोडफोड, लुटपाट र आगजनीमध्ये केही नागरिकको आवेशबाट सिर्जित स्वतःस्फूर्त घटना भए पनि केही घटनाले योजनाबद्ध हिंसा प्रयोगको संकेत गर्ने प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । सरकारी संस्था, व्यवसाय, सञ्चार संस्थामाथि भएको आक्रमणमा जेन–जी आन्दोलनसँग प्रत्यक्ष सम्बन्ध नभएका व्यक्तिहरूको संलग्नता देखिएको प्रतिवेदनले औंल्याएको छ । ह्युमन राइट्स वाचकी एसिया क्षेत्र उपनिर्देशक मिनाक्षी गांगुलीले २३ भदौमा नेपालमा भएको हिंसात्मक घटनामा गम्भीर मानवअधिकार उल्लंघन भएको बताएकी छन् । ‘यसमा जिम्मेवार सुरक्षा निकायका अधिकारी वा राजनीतिक पात्रहरूलाई जवाफदेही बनाइनुपर्छ,’ उनले भनेकी छन्, ‘सरकारले यसमा हुने अनुसन्धानलाई स्वतन्त्र र पारदर्शी रूपमा समयमै पूरा गर्नुपर्छ र कानुन उल्लंघन गर्ने जोकोहीलाई कारबाहीबाट जोगाइने छैन भन्ने सुनिश्चित गर्नुपर्छ ।’ Register and Get a

Thank you for your interest! Click here प्रतिवेदन तयार पार्ने क्रममा ५२ प्रत्यक्षदर्शी, पीडित, पत्रकार, स्वास्थ्यकर्मी, राजनीतिज्ञ र सुरक्षा निकायसँग जोडिएको स्रोतसँग अन्तर्वार्ता गरिएको ह्युमन राइट्स वाचले जनाएको छ । ‘सामाजिक सञ्जालमा सार्वजनिक वा अनुसन्धानकर्तालाई दिइएका तस्बिर र भिडियो, अस्पताल एवं प्रदर्शन र आगजनी भएका स्थानहरूमा गरिएको स्थलगत अध्ययनबाट यो प्रतिवेदन तयार गरिएको हो,’ ह्युमन राइट्स वाचले भनेको छ, ‘यो अध्ययन काठमाडौंमा केन्द्रित थियो ।’ प्रत्यक्षदर्शीसँगको कुराकानी र विश्लेषण गरिएकाले फुटेजले २३ भदौमा प्रहरीलाई तत्काल वा केहीबेरमा खतरा हुने अवस्था नदेखिएकाले त्यो दिन घातक हतियार प्रयोगको औचित्य पुष्टि नहुने निष्कर्ष प्रतिवेदनले निकालेको छ । युवालाई तितरबितर पार्न प्रहरीले त्यो दिन दिउँसो १२:३० देखि ४ बजेसम्ममा घातक हतियार प्रयोग गरेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । ‘उनीहरूको टाउको, छाती र पेटमा गोली हानिएको छ,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ । ‘डिस्कर्ड’ सहितका सामाजिक सञ्जालमार्फत तयारी गरेर ९ बजेदेखि भेला हुन थालेका प्रदर्शनकारीको भीड ११ बजेसम्ममा ठूलो बनिसकेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । ‘प्रदर्शनकारी संसद् भवनतर्फ अगाडि बढ्दै जाँदा केहीले सडकको एकातर्फ रहेको ब्यारिकेड पार गरे,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘प्रहरीले उनीहरूलाई तितरबितर पार्न अश्रुग्यास, पानीका फोहोरा र लाठी प्रयोग गरे ।’ त्यस बेला ठूलो संख्यामा प्रदर्शनकारी संसद् भवनको मुख्य गेटमा भेला भइसकेका थिए भने केहीले प्रहरीतर्फ ढुंगा हानेका थिए । करिब १२:३० बजे सरकारले कर्फ्यु आदेश जारी गरेको थियो । तर त्यसबारे कुनै सूचना सरकारले नदिएको थाहा नपाएको अनुसन्धानकर्ताले कुरा गरेका प्रदर्शनकारी र पत्रकारले बताएका छन् । कर्फ्यु आदेश जारी भएको ५ मिनेटपछि नै प्रहरीले घातक हतियारबाट गोली चलाउन थालेको एक प्रहरी अधिकारीले जानकारी दिएका छन् । दिउँसो १ बजेसम्ममा परिस्थिति निकै बिग्रिसकेको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । अन्तर्वार्ता गरिएका कुनै पनि प्रत्यक्षदर्शीले घातक हतियार प्रयोगअघि प्रहरीले चेतावनी दिएको थाहा नपाएको बताएका छन् । १:४० बजे २० वर्षीय विद्यार्थीको काँधमा गोली लाग्दासम्म शान्तिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन भइरहेको भनिएको छ । ‘सबै कुरा शान्त हुँदा प्रहरीले अचानक बिनाकारण गोली चलाउन थाल्यो,’ एक विद्यार्थीले भनेकी छन् । बेलुकी संसद् भवनभित्र रहेको स्पेसल टाक्स फोर्स (एसटीएफ) ले ३३ विद्यार्थीलाई संसद् भवनको चौरमा नियन्त्रणमा राखेको भनिएको छ । उनीहरूलाई कुटपिटसँगै धम्की दिइएको र बेलुकी छाडिएको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । प्रतिवेदनमा प्रहरीले अस्पताल परिसरमै प्रवेश गरेर लाठीचार्ज गरेको सन्दर्भ पनि उल्लेख छ । त्यस क्रममा कर्मचारीसमेत घाइते भएको भनिएको छ । अनुसन्धानकर्ताले अन्तर्वार्ता गरेका एक पूर्वप्रहरी वरिष्ठ अधिकारीले प्रदर्शन नियन्त्रण र प्राणघातक बल प्रयोगसम्बन्धी प्रक्रिया पालनामा प्रहरी असफल भएको टिप्पणी गरेका छन् । ‘संयुक्त राष्ट्रसंघको बल र घातक हतियार प्रयोगसम्बन्धी आधारभूत सिद्धान्तले मृत्यु वा गम्भीर चोटको आसन्न खतराबाहेक बन्दुक प्रयोग गर्न निषेध गर्छ,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ, ‘जीवन रक्षा गर्न पूर्ण रूपमा अपरिहार्य भएको अवस्थामा मात्र जानाजान प्राणघातक गोली चलाउन पाइन्छ ।’ नेपालको कानुनअनुसार पनि सुरक्षा संयन्त्रलाई घातक हतियार प्रयोग गर्न आदेश हुँदा पनि पूर्वचेतावनी र मृत्यु नहुने उपाय अपनाउनुपर्ने भनिएको छ । ‘विगतमा भएका मानवअधिकार उल्लंघनकर्तामा कायम रहेको दण्डहीनताले नै यस पटक नेपालमा हिंसालाई सम्भव बनायो, सरकारहरूले दशकौंसम्म छानबिन गर्ने र अभियोजन रोक्ने प्रवृत्तिलाई उल्टाउनु अत्यावश्यक छ,’ ह्युमन राइट्स वाचकी एसिया क्षेत्र उपनिर्देशक गांगुलीले भनेकी छन् । पहिलो दिनको बल प्रयोगको परिणाम दोस्रो दिन २३ भदौको भीडमा मुख्य गरी युवा प्रदर्शनकारी मात्र भए पनि दोस्रो दिनको हिंसा र आगजनीमा अन्य समूह रहेको प्रत्यक्षदर्शी र विश्लेषकको भनाइ प्रतिवेदनमा उद्धृत गरिएको छ । म्याग्दीको एक स्थानीय तहको ‘सिस्टम ह्याक’ गरेरसमेत प्रदर्शनका लागि उक्साउने सन्देश प्रवाह गरिएको पनि उल्लेख छ । ‘उक्त सन्देशमा निर्दोष बालबालिकाको रगत बगाउने नेताको रगत बगे मात्र नेपालमा शान्ति आउँछ भनिएको थियो,’ प्रतिवेदनमा भनिएको छ । व्यक्तिको सम्पत्तिमाथि आक्रमण गर्न उक्साउने वा निर्देशन दिने सामग्री सामाजिक सञ्जाल तथा ‘डिस्कर्ड’ मा फैलाइएको देखिएको प्रत्यक्षदर्शीको भनाइ र समाचारमा पनि पाइएको प्रतिवेदनमा उल्लेख छ । प्रदर्शनकारीले प्रहरी कार्यालयहरूमा समेत तोडफोड, आगजनी र हतियार लुटपाट गरेको भनिएको छ । त्यसक्रममा तीन प्रहरीको समेत कुटपिटबाट मृत्यु भयो । प्रतिवेदनअनुसार प्रहरी चौकीतर्फ पहिलो आक्रमण २४ भदौको ११:३४ मा

"how far must one help a family member in Nepal? Personal situation, please advice","&amp;#x200B;

Hi,  
I am 25 (F) and have a cousin who is 32 (M). I am very frustrated because of my cousin. I have it hard time understanding why someone can be so irresponsible to not get a job in his lifetime. He is now a financial burden to the family, my father who is raising him because he became an orphan sadly.  
I asked him a few days ago why he hasn't gotten a job, he said earning money is not important to him.  
I understand that money isn't everything but we are not like rich people. We have enough to get by but we never have enough for activities like travelling and eating out.  
Nepal ma job paunu garo cha bhan cha. Is this true because dada ko friends ko jobs cha ani beh pani bhako cha.   
All my dad wants is for us to stand on our own two feet and take care of ourselves.

All my dad wants is for us to stand on our own two feet and take care of ourselves.  
I got irritated because he asked me to buy him an iPhone and was complaining that his OPPO phone was glitching. Is it right for someone who doesn't value money, and is not taking care of his finances to ask for that? He relies on our 94-year-old grandpa for his pension money which is like 2k in 3 months and my father also gets a pension as he has retired too.  
I find this pathetic because I have worked and earned money to support myself and my parents in some sense. But I hope to earn enough to give back to my parents.  
I find that he is entitled and recently I had to chip in my savings to support him for his hospital surgery bills, along with the pensions combined.  
Now he will have to go through some chemotherapy and I am so frustrated because it's gonna be difficult. Had he had some savings and earnings, he could've helped himself.  
He also got rejections from some marriage prospects because I believe he does not have a job so why would any female or the parents want to give their daughter's hand over to this man?  
Is this Nepali culture? To bend over backs to help the family? while someone is working hard, the other does not and slacks off. im 7 years younger than him   
Daddy even thought he was not going anywhere in life and has begun some construction and building for his future. But that takes money too so there a struggle in that.   
Should I get him the phone? Like I don't understand him.

स्ववियुलाई चन्दा असुली र आतंकको अखडा बनाउने कि विद्यार्थी कल्याणको ज्ञानपुञ्ज ?,"स्ववियुमा पार्टीहरूको यस्तो दबदबा र हस्तक्षेप नहुने कानुनी प्रबन्ध गर्न एउटा संसदीय समितिको गठन किन नगर्ने ? विश्व इतिहासमा युगीन राजनीतिक परिवर्तनका संवाहकका रूपमा विभिन्न विद्यार्थी आन्दोलनहरूको स्मरण गर्ने गरिन्छ । गत वर्ष बंगलादेशमा विद्यार्थीहरूको विद्रोहले चार/चार पटक चुनाव जितेकी शेख हसिनालाई अहिले दिल्लीमा शरणार्थीको रूपमा सीमित गरिदिएको छ । सन् २०१८ मा झन्डै झन्डै ८६ प्रतिशत संसद उहाँको नियन्त्रणमा थियो, पूरै राजनीतिक प्रणाली कब्जा गरेकी थिइन् । यहाँ दुई तिहाइको दम्भको कहिलेकाँही प्रदर्शन हुन्छ, हसिनाले पछिल्लोमा पनि झन्डै झन्डै तीन चौथाइ संसदीय पकड थियो तर एक महिनाको अवधिमा विद्यार्थीहरूको बलमा उनी आज बहिर्गमित अवस्थामा छिन् । सन् १९६८ मा सम्पूर्ण पाश्चात्य जगत् नै हल्लाउनेगरी टोकियोदेखि पेरिस, लण्डनदेखि सन- फ्रान्सिस्कोसम्म भएका विद्यार्थी आन्दोलनहरूले एक किसिमको सांस्कृतिक पानीढलो नै स्थापित गर्‍यो । दोस्रो विश्वयुद्धपछि जन्मिएको पुस्ताले भियतनाम युद्ध, लैंगिक समतादेखि लिएर अनेक मुद्दाहरूलाई उठाउँदै एककिसिमको ‘कल्चरल वाटरसेड’ नै स्थापित गरेको हामीले देख्न पायौं । चीन जस्तो फरक राजनीतिक पृष्ठभूमिको मुलुकमा पनि सन् १९१९ मा विद्यार्थीहरूले गरेको आन्दोलनबाट नै त्यहाँको राजनीतिक कोल्टेफेराइ भएको हामी हेर्न सक्दछौं । कम्युनिष्ट पार्टीको स्थापना पनि त्यसैको प्रेरणामा भएको, र त्यही कम्युनिष्ट प्रणालीलाई चुनौती दिने गरेर त्यसको ७० वर्षपछि तियानमेन स्क्वायरमा भएको विद्रोह पनि विद्यार्थीहरूबाटै भएको थियो । हाम्रै नेपालमा पनि २०३६ सालदेखिको उदाहरणहरू हेर्दा जुल्फिकर अलि भुट्टोलाई फासी दिएपछि भड्किएको विद्यार्थी आन्दोलन जनमत संग्रहसम्म पुग्यो । बलबहादुर केसी, शरणविक्रम मल्लहरूलाई ठेलागाडामा राखेर मोसो दलिएको इतिहास हामीले पनि पढेका छौं । तर, त्यो प्रेरणादायी राजनीतिक परिवर्तनलाई एउटा विद्यार्थीहरूकै बलमा कोल्टेफेराइ र परिवर्तन गरिएको स्मरणीय इतिहास हामी सबैले गौरव गर्नलायक पनि छ । यो ऐतिहासिकताको आलोकमा विद्यार्थीहरूको आन्दोलनहरूको इतिहास एकदमै गौरवशाली पनि छ । तर गत केही हप्तादेखि नेपालका हजारभन्दा क्याम्पसहरूमा जुन किसिमको ताण्डव देखिंदैछ, तालाबन्दीदेखि बन्द हड्ताल, कुटपिट, तोडफोड, चन्दा आतंक, दलभित्रका गुटगत प्रदर्शन इत्यादि र माउ पार्टीका कमाण्डरहरू नै तोकेर जुन किसिमले कण कणमा राजनीतीकरण र दलीयकरण गरिएको छ, विश्वविद्यालयहरू र उच्च शिक्षा प्रणालीलाई क्षतविक्षत गर्ने तरिकाले कामहरू अगाडि बढेका छन्, त्यो असाध्यै चिन्ताजनक छ । चेतनाको थलो हुनुपर्ने क्याम्पसहरू आज रणमैदान बनेका छन् । हाम्रा विश्वविद्यालयहरू स्वायत्त हुनुपर्ने होइन र ? एक दुई दिनको समय लिएर एकदमै शान्तिपूर्ण तरिकाले क्याम्पसका प्रशासकहरूले सामान्य तबरले गराउन सक्ने निर्वाचनहरू आज जुन प्रतिष्ठाको लडाइँ, जुँगाको भिडन्त देखिइराखेको छ, त्यो असाध्यै निन्दनीय नै छ । म पढ्दै थिएँ, गत वर्ष लगातार तीन/चार वर्षदेखि एक लाखभन्दा बढी नो अब्जेक्सन सर्टिफिकेटहरू इस्यु भएका छन् । यो देशभित्रै पढ्न सकिएन, अब बाहिर नै जानुपर्छ भन्नेछ । सरकारी अड्डाहरूमा पनि दैनिक दुई हजार जति निवेदन पर्ने र कर्मचारीहरूले १२ घन्टा काम गर्दा पनि जम्मा सय वटाजति नो अब्जेक्सन सर्टिफिकेट, एउटा बाढी नै छ । यो प्रतिभाशाली विद्यार्थी र प्राचार्यहरूको जुन डरलाग्दो पलायन छ, त्यसको कारण के होला ? अब खोज्ने बेला भएन र ? त्यसैले केही दर्जन नेता उत्पादन गर्नका लागि लाखौं नेपाली युवाहरू, विद्यार्थीहरूको भविष्य जोखिममा राख्ने गरिएको छ । पछिल्लो समय केआईआईटीको प्रसंगबारे यो संसदमा हामीले छलफल गर्‍यौं । प्रकृति लम्सालको दुःखद निधन सँगसँगै उडिसा जस्तो गरिब राज्यको एउटा सहरको एउटा कुनामा रहेको विश्वविद्यालयमा पनि १५ सय नेपाली विद्यार्थीहरू पढ्छन् भन्दा हामी झसंग पनि भएका थियौं । त्यसैले यो समाजमा घृणा फैलाउने कारखानाको रूपमा विश्वविद्यालयलाई हामीले जसरी उत्पादन गरिरहेका छौं, त्यो असाध्यै सुधार गर्नुपर्ने दिशातिर हामी जानुपर्नेछ । आज संसदमा रहनुभएका धेरै नेताहरू विद्यार्थी आन्दोलनबाटै आउनुभएको छ । २०३६ साल, २०४६ सालका कुराहरू त मैले स्मरण गरें तर शैक्षिक सुधार, विश्वविद्यालयहरूको सुधारमा उहाँहरूको भूमिका के कस्तो छ, त्यो इतिहासको कठघरामा पनि उहाँहरू उभिनुहुनेछ । म बेलायतको सहयोगमा बनेको बूढानीलकण्ठ स्कुलमा पढ्ने सौभाग्य पाएँ । सन् १९८७ मा पशुपति शमशेर राणा शिक्षामन्त्री हुनुहुन्थ्यो । उहाँले मलाई पुरस्कार दिएको मलाई सम्झना छ । म सानो विद्यार्थी हुँदा । तर आज त्यो बूढानीलकण्ठ स्कुल त्यो ब्रिटिशको पालाको जस्तो रहेन, शैक्षिक स्तर खस्कियो भन्दा मलाई मन चसक्क हुन्छ । तपाईंहरूको मन दुख्दैन, आफूले पढेर आएका क्याम्पसहरूको आज यो दुर्दशा देख्दा ? भर्नादर घटेका छन् । प्रविधिमा लगानी छैन । अनुसन्धान ठप्प छ । सोध छैनन् । र, यो पलायनको डरलाग्दो प्रवाह कसरी रोक्ने ? त्यसैले सुधारमा यहाँ अनेकअनेक विषयमा संसदीय समितिहरूको माग हुन्छ । गरौं न एउटा संसदीय समितिको गठन । स्वतन्त्र विद्यार्थी युनियनहरूको संरचना र निर्वाचन प्रक्रियामा सुधार गर्नुपर्ने बेला भएन ? पार्टीहरूको यस्तो दबदबा र हस्तक्षेप नहुने कानुनी प्रबन्ध गरौं । स्ववियुको भूमिका नै पुनर्परिभाषित गर्नुपर्नेछ । यिनीहरू चन्दा असुलीको थलो र आतंकको अखडा होइन, विद्यार्थी कल्याणको एउटा ज्ञानपुञ्ज बनाउने गरी अगाडि जाऔं । विश्वविद्यालयको स्वायत्तता बारे पनि हामीले अब फरक ढंगले सघन बहस गर्नुपर्ने बेला आएको छ । विश्वविद्यालयहरूलाई गुणस्तरीय, अनुसन्धानमुखी, नवीन विचारको थलो बनाउने कि पार्टीको खेलौना बनाएर उच्च शिक्षा प्रणालीलाई ध्वस्त बनाउने ? यो यक्ष प्रश्न अब समाजका, नागरिक समाजका अगुवाहरू वा विचारहरू मात्र होइन, यो संसदप्रति पनि तेर्सिएको म मान्दछु । (चैत ३ गतेको प्रतिनिधिसभा बैठकमा  सांसद वाग्लेले गरेको सम्बोधनको अंश) खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित आक्रोशित","स्ववियुलाई चन्दा असुली र आतंकको अखडा बनाउने कि विद्यार्थी कल्याणको ज्ञानपुञ्ज ?

"पीडित डाक्टरको बयान– शिक्षकको दबाबले विक्षिप्त थिएँ, आत्मसम्मान गुमेपछि औषधि खाएर ढलेँ","निरन्तर शिक्षकले आफूमाथि मानसिक यातना र गाली गलोज गरेकै कारण आत्महत्या प्रयास गर्न बाध्य भएको ती चिकित्सकले बताइन् । ६ चैत, काठमाडौं । काठमाडौं विश्वविद्यालय स्कुल अफ मेडिकल साइन्स (धुलिखेल अस्पताल)को मानसिक रोग विभागका दुई चिकित्सकमाथि नेपाल मेडिकल काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण सोधेको छ । उनीहरूलाई ‘किन कारबाही नगर्ने’ भन्दै काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण सोधेको हो । धुलिखेल अस्पतालको एमडी पहिलो वर्षमा अध्ययनरत एक विद्यार्थीले गत ४ फागुन (आइतबार) आत्महत्याको प्रयास गरेकी थिइन् । आत्महत्या प्रयास गर्नुको कारणमा चिकित्सकले निरन्तर दिएको मानसिक दबाब र गालीगलौज गरेको आवासीय चिकित्सकहरूको आरोप थियो । धुलिखेल अस्पतालको मानसिक रोग विभागका प्रमुख डा. अजय रिसाल, सोही विभागका डा. दीपक कुँवर, डा. वर्षा श्रेष्ठ र डा. रिका रिजाललाई निलम्बन गर्दै आरोपित चिकित्सक र पीडित दुवै पक्षको १८ फागुनमा बयान लिएको थियो । बयानको आधारमा मानसिक रोग विभागका प्रमुख डा. अजय रिसाल, सोही विभागका डा. दीपक कुँवरलाई किन कारबाही नगर्ने भन्दै मेडिकल काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण साधेको हो । ‘विद्यार्थीहरूले लगाएको आरोप, सत्य हो कि होइन भनेर पुनः एकपटक स्पष्टीकरण सोध्ने निर्णय गरेका हौं,’ काउन्सिलका एक सदस्यले अनलाइनखबरसँग भने, ‘उजुरी भएको आधारमा हेर्दा आंशिक दोषी देखिएको आधारमा किन कारबाही नगर्ने भन्दै स्पष्टीकरण सोधेका हौं ।’ ती सदस्यले थपे, ‘अनुसन्धानको क्रममा दुई चिकित्सक बढी केन्द्रित देखिएकाले स्पष्टीकरण सोध्ने निर्णय गरेका हौं ।’ काउन्सिलको व्यावसायिक आचरण समितिका संयोजक डा.विश्वराज दवाडी, सहसंयोजक डा. कुन्जाङ शेर्पा र सदस्यहरू डा. आनन्दकुमार शर्मा, डा. रूपक बीके घिमिरे र राजेश्वर अधिकारीको पाँच सदस्यीय समितिले बयान लिएको थियो । ती सदस्यका अनुसार कारबाही लागि भने निर्णय भइसकेको छैन । उनीहरूले दिएको स्पष्टीकरणका आधारमा कस्तो कारबाही हुने भन्ने निर्णय हुने ती सदस्यले बताए । काउन्सिलले विभागमा कार्यरत चार चिकित्सकलाई काम नगर्न एक हप्ताको लागि निलम्बन गर्दै अनुसन्धान सुरु गरेको थियो । आवासीय चिकित्सकले निरन्तर दिएको दबाबका कारण पनि केयू डीन कार्यालयले स्वतन्त्र छानबिन समिति बनाएर उपकुलपतिलाई ५ दिनभित्र प्रतिवेदन पेस गर्ने निर्णय गरेको थियो । तर हालसम्म पनि उक्त प्रतिवेदन सार्वजानिक भएको छैन । निलम्बनमा परेका कुनै पनि चिकित्सकलाई नियमित हैसियतको काम-कारबाही गर्न नदिने जनाउँदै समितिले प्रतिवेदन पेस नगर्दाको अवधिसम्मका लागि मानसिक विभागमा कार्यरत शिक्षकहरूलाई शैक्षिक, चिकित्सकीय र एसोसिएट डीनको हैसियतमा काम काजमा संलग्न नगर्ने र नगराउने जनाएको छ । आवासीय चिकित्सकले घटनाबारे आंशका जनाउँदै सत्य तथ्य छानबिन गर्न माग गरेका छन् । घटना पहिलो नभई यसअघि पनि पटकपटक भएको उनीहरूको आरोप छ । निरन्तर शिक्षकले आफूमाथि मानसिक यातना र गाली गलोज गरेकै कारण आत्महत्या प्रयास गर्न बाध्य भएको ती चिकित्सकले अनलाइनखबरसँग बताइन् । ‘सानो गल्तीलाई पनि ठूलो बनाएर गाली गर्नुहुन्थ्यो । तिमीहरू यति पनि नजान्ने, तिमीहरू धर्तिको बोझ हौ लगायतका सुन्नै नसक्ने शब्द प्रयोग गर्नुहुन्थ्यो,’ ती चिकित्सकले अनलाइनखबरसँगको कुराकानीमा भनिन्, ‘४ फागुन गतेको घटनाले मलाई आत्महत्या गर्ने सोचमा पुर्‍यायो ।’ उनका अनुसार डा. अजय लगायतका अन्य चिकित्सकले बिरामीकै अगाडि फाइल फाल्दै प्रत्येक दिन गाली गरिरहन्थे । शिक्षकबाट हुने गरेको मानसिक तनाबकै कारण आफूमा डर पैदा भएको र त्यसले आफ्नो अध्ययनको गुणस्तर पनि खस्किएको उनलेअनलाइनखबरसँग बताइन् । ‘बिहान उठेपछि वार्ड जानै मन लाग्दैनथ्यो । राउन्ड जाँदा कुन डाक्टरको गाली खाइने हो भने तनाव भइरहन्थ्यो,’ विगतका दिन सम्झिँदै उनले भनिन्, ‘राउन्डमा जाँदा हात-खुट्टा काम्थ्यो । जसका कारण मैले मानसिक रोगको औषधि समेत सेवन गर्नुपर्यो ।’ उनले आत्महत्याको गर्नुको पछाडि गत ४ गतेको घटनासँगै त्यसभन्दा अगाडिका शिक्षकबाट निरन्तर हुने गरेको मानसिक तनाव नै रहेको आरोप लगाइन् ।  ‘दिउँसो ४ बजेतिर साँझ राउन्ड सकेर आत्महत्या गर्ने सोच आयो । निरन्तरको दबाबबाट छुटकारा पाउनका लागि मैले ३० वटा ट्याबलेट खाएँ,’ ती चिकित्सकले भनिन्, ‘औषधि खाएपछि छट्पटी सुरु हुन थाल्यो र साथीहरूलाई माफ गरिदेऊ भन्दै म्यासेज पठाएँ ।’ विभागीय प्रमुख र एसोसिएट प्रोफेसरबाट पटकपटक दुर्व्यवहार भएको आवासीय चिकित्सकको भनाइ छ । अस्पतालको मानसिक रोग विभागमा ७ जना आवासीय चिकित्सक अध्ययन गर्छन् । एमडी पहिलो वर्ष ३ जना, दोस्रो र तेस्रो वर्ष २–२ जना अध्ययन गरिरहेका छन् । एक वर्षअघि पनि एक जना विद्यार्थीले दुर्व्यवहारकै कारण आत्महत्याको प्रयास गरेको तथा एक जना विद्यार्थीबीचमै पढाइ छोडेका थिए । निरन्तर आत्महत्याको प्रयास हुन थालेपछि सहपाठीहरू विरोधमा उत्रिए र सत्यतथ्यको अनुसन्धानका गर्नका लागि केयूलाई दबाब दिए । तर, विद्यार्थीको उठाएको विषयमा अस्पताल र विश्वविद्यालयले वास्ता गरेन बरु उल्टै उनीहरूको आवाज दबाउन धम्कीको भाषा प्रयोग गर्‍यो । त्यसपछि भने कानुनी उपचार खोज्न नेपाल मेडिकल काउन्सिलमा उजुरी दिए । कसरी आत्महत्या गर्ने बाटोमा पुगिन् ? एमडी पहिलो वर्षमा अध्ययन गर्ने ती चिकित्सकले आफू कसरी आत्महत्याको बाटोसम्म पुग्न बाध्य भएको सविस्तार बयान अनलाइनखबरसँग राखेकी छिन् । उनै चिकित्सककै भनाइजस्ताको जस्तैउतारिएको छ: मेरो नाम अस्मिता (नाम परिवर्तन) हो । एमबीबीएस अध्ययन गर्दा नै मलाई मानसिक विषय पढ्न रुचि थियो । सन् २०२१ मा एमबीबीएस युनिभर्सल कलेज अफ मेडिकल साइन्सेस भैरहवाबाट गरेको हुँ । २०२२ विवाह भएसँगै छोरी जन्मिएकाले केही वर्ष पढाइलाई निरन्तरता दिन सकिनँ । मनोचिकित्सकले मनको कुरा बुझ्नपर्ने, निरन्तर काउन्सिल गनुपर्ने हुँदा बिरामीसँग नजिकको सम्बन्ध हुने हुँदा यस विषयमा अधिक रुचि थियो । रुचिको विषय पनि भएकाले मनोचिकित्सक विधामा राम्रो पढ्न सक्ने अपेक्षासहित एमडीको लागि नाम निकाल्दै धुलिखेल अस्पतालमा अध्ययनका लागि जोडिएँ । किनकि, धुलिखेल अस्पतालको मानसिक रोग विभाग एकदमै राम्रो भएको, राम्रा शिक्षक भएको गाइँगुइँ सुनेको थिएँ । गत वैशाखबाट अध्ययन पनि सुरु भयो । सुरुका दिनमा पढाइ राम्रो चलिरहेको थियो । सिनियर दाइ-दिदीलाई शिक्षक गालीगलोज गर्दा मनमा कताकता दुखेको जस्तो हुन्थ्यो । तर हामीलाई सुरु सुरुमा भने गालीगलोज भएन । पहिलो वर्षमा तीन जना अध्ययनरत छौं । सोधेको जवाफ हामीले दिँदा शिक्षकले सिनियर विद्यार्थीले पटकपटक गाली खाइरहेका हुन्थेँ । तिमीहरूलाई यति पनि आउँदैन, भर्खरै आएका जुनियरले जवाफ दिइसक्यो भनेर गाली गर्नुहुन्थ्यो । चार –पाँच महिना बितेपछि गालीगलोज हामीले पनि खान थाल्यौं । सधैं नै राउन्ड गर्दा वा ओपीडीमा बस्दाको गाली मात्रै वातावरण हुन्थ्यो । गाली पनि साधारण खालको हुँदैनथ्यो । केही कारणवश सानो गल्ती भयो भने पनि ठूलो बनाउँदै थर्काउनुहुन्थ्यो । ‘तिमीहरू यति पनि जान्दैनौं । घर्तिको बोझ, बाआमालाई बोझ बनाएर किन पढ्न आएको’ भन्ने खालका शब्द पटकपटक प्रयोग हुन्थ्यो । कहिलेकाहीँ त सामान्य गल्ती हुँदा पनि बिरामी अगाडि फाइल फालिदिएको घटना छन् । दैनिक रुपमा गाली खान थालेपछि ममा डर पैदा भयो । बिहान उठेपछि वार्ड जान मन नलाग्ने, डाक्टरको गाली खाइने हो कि भनेर तनावले राउन्ड हुँदा हातखुट्टा काम्ने समस्या देखियो । डरकै कारण मेरो अध्ययनको गुणस्तर पनि खस्कँदै गयो । तर कुनै शिक्षकले के भयो भनेर सोध्नसमेत चाहनुभएन । तर अझ गालीगलोजको वातावरण बन्दै गयो । जसले गर्दा अध्ययनमा ठूलो असर पर्यो ।  एमबीबीएस सकिएपछि विवाह भयो । त्यसपछि छोरी जन्मिइन् । सानी छोरीलाई घरमा छोडेर आउनुपर्दा छोरीको याद आइरहन्थ्यो । सुरुवाती दिनमा शिक्षकसँग छोरीको याद बेलाबेलामा आइरहने र कहिलेकाहीँ गाह्रो समेत हुने गरेको बताएको थिएँ । तर शिक्षकले त्यही कुरालाई लिएर इमोसनल ब्ल्याकमेल गरेको आरोप पटकपटक लगाए । कहिलेकहीँ गोप्य रुपमा भनेको कुरालाई राउन्डमा सबैको अगाडि भनिदिने गरे । छोरीको याद र शिक्षकबाट हुने गालीगलोजले मलाई मानसिक रुपमा थप बिछिप्त बनाउँदै लग्यो । त्यसपछि विभागमा कार्यरत एक कन्सल्टेन्टसँग मानसिक रुपमा गाह्रो भएकाले कुनै औषधि सिफारिस गरिदन आग्रह गरेँ । तर औषधि नचाहिने बताएपछि म आफैंले औषधि खान थालेँ । १७ माघमा छोरीको जन्मदिन मनाउन दुई दिन बिदा लिएर घर गएकी थिएँ । बिदाको विषयलाई लिएर राउन्डमा सबै जनाको अगाडि नै इमोसनल ब्ल्याकमेल गरेर बिदा मागेको भन्दै डा. अजयले हकार्नुभयो । यो तिम्रो अन्तिम बिदा हो, अब तेस्रो वर्षसम्म एक दिन बिदा पाइँदैन भन्दै झपार्नुभयो । माघको अन्तिम साता हुनुपर्छ, बिरामीलाई डिस्चार्ज गर्ने विषयलाई डा. जयाले सहनै नसक्नेगरी गाली गर्नुभयो । बिरामीलाई भर्ना गरिएको ५ दिन भएको थियो । अझै दुई दिन राख्नुपर्ने भनेर मैले योजना बनाएकी थिएँ । त्यहीअनुरुप बिरामीका आफन्तलाई परामर्श पनि गरेँ । आफन्तले लैजान जिद्दी गरिरहेका थिए । ती बिरामीलाई डा. जयाले हेर्ने योजना बनाउनुभएको रहेछ । ‘उहाँहरूले बिरामी लैजाने भनिराख्नुभएको छ, मैले दुई दिन राख्नुपर्ने भनिरहेको छु । हजुरले परामर्श गर्दा त्यही हिसाबले कुरा गरिदिनु’ भनेर अनुरोध गरेँ । किनकि, दुई जनाको कुरा फरक खालको नहोस् भन्ने मेरो धारणा थियो । तर त्यतिबेला डा. जयाले केही प्रतिक्रिया दिनुभएन । तर वार्डमा हामीहरूबीच भएको कुरालाई लिएर सिनियर डाक्टरलाई मैले सिकाउन खोजें भन्दै कुरा लगाउनुभएको रहेछ । गत ४ फागुनमा वार्डमा भएका बिरामीका आफन्तले डिस्चार्ज दिन पटकपटक अनुरोध गरेका थिए । भर्ना भएको १२ दिन पुगेको थियो । सबै हिसाबले हेर्दा बिरामीलाई पठाउन मिल्ने अवस्था थियो । तर मैले नै अझै दुई दिन अस्पताल बस्दा रामै हुने भन्दै बिरामीको आफन्तलाई परामर्श गरेको थिए । तर भोलिपल्ट भान्जाको विवाह हुने भएकाले ती व्यक्तिले पटकपटक डिस्चार्ज गर्न अनुरोध गरे । राउन्डमा डा. अजयलाई बिरामी बस्न नमानेको र डिस्चार्ज गर्दा पनि फरक नपर्ने हुँदा डिस्चार्जको तयारी गर्दा कस्तो होला भनेर सोधे । तर उहाँले रिसाउँदै भन्नुभयो, ‘तिमी केही पनि गर्न सक्देनौं । बिरामीलाई राख्नु सक्ने क्षमता पनि छैन । तिमीले त सिनियर डाक्टरलाई काम लगाउन पनि जानेको छौं ।’ वार्डमा नर्स, बिरामी र बिरामीको आफन्तको अगाडि डा. अजयले औंला देखाउँदै हकार्नुभयो । पुरानो घटनालाई कोट्याउँदै ठूलै गल्ती गरेको जसरी बेस्करी कराउँदै भन्नुभयो, ‘तिमीहरूले सक्दैनौ भने छोडेर गए हुन्छ । मनोचिकित्सक बन्न लायक छनौं, तिमीमा मानवीय संवेदना पनि छैन ।’ अन्य कुनै पनि विषयमा पढ्न नपाएर फालिएर मनोचिकित्सा विभागमा आएको हो । डाक्टर भन्न पनि लायक नभएको सुन्न नसकिने खालका शब्दले गाली गर्नुभयो । त्यो घटनाले के गल्ती गरेँ र यस्तो शब्द सुन्नुपर्यो भनेर दिमागमा त्यही कुरा खेलिरह्यो । बिरामीको अगाडि नै गाली गर्न थालेपछि मलाई निकै अपमान महसुस भयो । त्यसै दिन दिउँसो १ बजे खाना खाने समयमा आत्महत्याको सोच आयो । १ बजे रुममा गएँ । घरमा फोन गरेर रुँदै यस्तो वातावरणमा पढ्न नसक्ने, बरु घरै फर्किने बताएँ । तर बुबाआमाले हतारमा निर्णय नगर भन्दै सम्झाउने कोसिस गर्नुभयो । त्यतिबेला आत्महत्या गरौं भन्ने सोच मनमा आइरहेको थियो । रुममा औषधि मात्रै फेला पारेँ । तर त्यति औषधिले मर्न सम्भव थिएन । दुई बजे ड्युटी सुरु भइहाल्ने थियो । त्यस दिन घटना मनमा खेलिरहँदा वार्डमा जान मन नै थिएन । बिहान डिस्चार्ज गर्न लागेको बिरामीको प्रक्रिया अगाडि बढाउनुपर्ने थियो । तर मलाई जान मन नै नलागेको कारण समकक्षीलाई डिस्चार्ज प्रक्रिया अगाडि बढाउन अनुरोध गरेँ । तर समकक्षीले डिस्चार्ज पेपर लिएर जाँदा डा. रियाले साइन गर्न नमानी उल्टै हप्काएर पठाउनुभएछ । २ बजे आकस्मिक कक्षबाट सिरियस केस आएको भन्दै फोन आयो । त्यसपछि म हतारहतार आकस्मिक कक्ष पुगेँ । त्यति नै बेला म्यामले साइन गर्न नमानेको र तिमीलाई नै बोलाएको समकक्षीले बताए । आकस्मिक कक्षमा सिरियस बिरामीलाई छोडेर म ओपीडी कक्ष पुगेँ । बिहानको घटनाले आत्महत्याको सोच विस्तारै हराएको थियो । तर, आकस्मिक कक्षमा जीवन र मरणको दोसाँधमा भएको बिरामीलाई हेर्न नपाउँदा मेरो मन कुँडियो र आत्महत्याको सोच झन् बलियो बन्यो । दिउँसो ४ बजेतिर राउन्ड सकेर ‘भोलि मेरो प्रिजेन्टेसन बनाउनु छ’ भन्दै कोठातिर लागेँ । निरन्तरको मानसिक यातनाले मलाई आत्महत्या गर्न सोच बलियो बनाउँदै लगेको थियो । कोठामा जानुअघि फार्मेसीबाट दुई पत्ता औषधि किनेँ । औषधि ३० ट्याबलेट थियो । रुममा अरु केही औषधि पनि बाँकी थियो । कोठा पुगेर मैले छिटोछिटो तीन–तीन वटा गर्दै ३० ट्याबलेट खाएँ । एउटा मनले आफूलाई केही भयो भने छोरीले दुःख पाउँछिन् भन्ने सोच पनि आइरहेको थियो । ३० वटा ट्याब्लेट खाइसकेपछि बेडमा सुतेँ । त्यसपछि भने डर लाग्ने थाल्यो । बिस्तारै साइड इफेक्ट (पेट दुख्ने, वाकवाकी लाग्ने) हुन थाल्यो । छटपटी हुन थालेपछि साथीहरूलाई मोबाइलबाटै मेसेज लेखेँ, ‘मैले गर्दा तिमीहरूले पनि गाली खानुपर्‍यो । अब म अध्ययन गर्न छोडिदिन्छु, मलाई माफ गरिदेऊ ।’ किनकि, हामीहरूले पहिलो वर्षमा अध्ययन गर्दा कसैले पनि नछोड्न र छोड्नुपरेको खण्डमा सबैले अध्ययन गर्न छोड्ने कसमसमेत खाएका थियौं । त्यही म्यासेजले हुनुपर्छ, साथीहरूको मनमा केही भयो कि भन्ने परेछ । केहीबेरमा साथीहरू मेरो कोठामा आइपुगे । केही साथीले ढोका ढक्ढक्याइरहे । धेरै कर गरेपछि मैले ढोका खोलेँ । आफूले औषधि सेवन गरेको बताएपछि साथीहरूले हतारहतार आकस्मिक कक्षमा लगेर भर्ना गरे । पछि आईसीयूमा राखेरसमेत उपचार गरियो । अहिले ठिक छु । तर यो घटनाले मानसिक रुपमा निकै तनाव भइरहेको छ । अब हाम्रो माग भनेको विभागमा कार्यरत चिकित्सकलाई सधैंको लागि हटाएर अर्को शिक्षक नियुक्त गर्नुपर्छ भन्ने हो । यस्तो वातावरणमा हामी अध्ययन गर्न सक्दैनौं । अनलाइनखबरमा आबद्ध चौलागाईं स्वास्थ्य विटमा कलम चलाउँछन् । खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित आक्रोशित","पीडित डाक्टरको बयान– शिक्षकको दबाबले विक्षिप्त थिएँ, आत्मसम्मान गुमेपछि औषधि खाएर ढलेँ निरन्तर शिक्षकले आफूमाथि मानसिक यातना र गाली गलोज गरेकै कारण आत्महत्या प्रयास गर्न बाध्य भएको ती चिकित्सकले बताइन् । ६ चैत, काठमाडौं । काठमाडौं विश्वविद्यालय स्कुल अफ मेडिकल साइन्स (धुलिखेल अस्पताल)को मानसिक रोग विभागका दुई चिकित्सकमाथि नेपाल मेडिकल काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण सोधेको छ । उनीहरूलाई ‘किन कारबाही नगर्ने’ भन्दै काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण सोधेको हो । धुलिखेल अस्पतालको एमडी पहिलो वर्षमा अध्ययनरत एक विद्यार्थीले गत ४ फागुन (आइतबार) आत्महत्याको प्रयास गरेकी थिइन् । आत्महत्या प्रयास गर्नुको कारणमा चिकित्सकले निरन्तर दिएको मानसिक दबाब र गालीगलौज गरेको आवासीय चिकित्सकहरूको आरोप थियो । धुलिखेल अस्पतालको मानसिक रोग विभागका प्रमुख डा. अजय रिसाल, सोही विभागका डा. दीपक कुँवर, डा. वर्षा श्रेष्ठ र डा. रिका रिजाललाई निलम्बन गर्दै आरोपित चिकित्सक र पीडित दुवै पक्षको १८ फागुनमा बयान लिएको थियो । बयानको आधारमा मानसिक रोग विभागका प्रमुख डा. अजय रिसाल, सोही विभागका डा. दीपक कुँवरलाई किन कारबाही नगर्ने भन्दै मेडिकल काउन्सिलले स्पष्टीकरण साधेको हो । ‘विद्यार्थीहरूले लगाएको आरोप, सत्य हो कि होइन भनेर पुनः एकपटक स्पष्टीकरण सोध्ने निर्णय गरेका हौं,’ काउन्सिलका एक सदस्यले अनलाइनखबरसँग भने, ‘उजुरी भएको आधारमा हेर्दा आंशिक दोषी देखिएको आधारमा किन कारबाही नगर्ने भन्दै स्पष्टीकरण सोधेका हौं ।’ ती सदस्यले थपे, ‘अनुसन्धानको क्रममा दुई चिकित्सक बढी केन्द्रित देखिएकाले स्पष्टीकरण सोध्ने निर्णय गरेका हौं ।’ काउन्सिलको व्यावसायिक आचरण समितिका संयोजक डा.विश्वराज दवाडी, सहसंयोजक डा. कुन्जाङ शेर्पा र सदस्यहरू डा. आनन्दकुमार शर्मा, डा. रूपक बीके घिमिरे र राजेश्वर अधिकारीको पाँच सदस्यीय समितिले बयान लिएको थियो । ती सदस्यका अनुसार कारबाही लागि भने निर्णय भइसकेको छैन । उनीहरूले दिएको स्पष्टीकरणका आधारमा कस्तो कारबाही हुने भन्ने निर्णय हुने ती सदस्यले बताए । काउन्सिलले विभागमा कार्यरत चार चिकित्सकलाई काम नगर्न एक हप्ताको लागि निलम्बन गर्दै अनुसन्धान सुरु गरेको थियो । आवासीय चिकित्सकले निरन्तर दिएको दबाबका कारण पनि केयू डीन कार्यालयले स्वतन्त्र छानबिन समिति बनाएर उपकुलपतिलाई ५ दिनभित्र प्रतिवेदन पेस गर्ने निर्णय गरेको थियो । तर हालसम्म पनि उक्त प्रतिवेदन सार्वजानिक भएको छैन । निलम्बनमा परेका कुनै पनि चिकित्सकलाई नियमित हैसियतको काम-कारबाही गर्न नदिने जनाउँदै समितिले प्रतिवेदन पेस नगर्दाको अवधिसम्मका लागि मानसिक विभागमा कार्यरत शिक्षकहरूलाई शैक्षिक, चिकित्सकीय र एसोसिएट डीनको हैसियतमा काम काजमा संलग्न नगर्ने र नगराउने जनाएको छ । आवासीय चिकित्सकले घटनाबारे आंशका जनाउँदै सत्य तथ्य छानबिन गर्न माग गरेका छन् । घटना पहिलो नभई यसअघि पनि पटकपटक भएको उनीहरूको आरोप छ । निरन्तर शिक्षकले आफूमाथि मानसिक यातना र गाली गलोज गरेकै कारण आत्महत्या

भनेर अनुरोध गरेँ । किनकि, दुई जनाको कुरा फरक खालको नहोस् भन्ने मेरो धारणा थियो । तर त्यतिबेला डा. जयाले केही प्रतिक्रिया दिनुभएन । तर वार्डमा हामीहरूबीच भएको कुरालाई लिएर सिनियर डाक्टरलाई मैले सिकाउन खोजें भन्दै कुरा लगाउनुभएको रहेछ । गत ४ फागुनमा वार्डमा भएका बिरामीका आफन्तले डिस्चार्ज दिन पटकपटक अनुरोध गरेका थिए । भर्ना भएको १२ दिन पुगेको थियो । सबै हिसाबले हेर्दा बिरामीलाई पठाउन मिल्ने अवस्था थियो । तर मैले नै अझै दुई दिन अस्पताल बस्दा रामै हुने भन्दै बिरामीको आफन्तलाई परामर्श गरेको थिए । तर भोलिपल्ट भान्जाको विवाह हुने भएकाले ती व्यक्तिले पटकपटक डिस्चार्ज गर्न अनुरोध गरे । राउन्डमा डा. अजयलाई बिरामी बस्न नमानेको र डिस्चार्ज गर्दा पनि फरक नपर्ने हुँदा डिस्चार्जको तयारी गर्दा कस्तो होला भनेर सोधे । तर उहाँले रिसाउँदै भन्नुभयो, ‘तिमी केही पनि गर्न सक्देनौं । बिरामीलाई राख्नु सक्ने क्षमता पनि छैन । तिमीले त सिनियर डाक्टरलाई काम लगाउन पनि जानेको छौं ।’ वार्डमा नर्स, बिरामी र बिरामीको आफन्तको अगाडि डा. अजयले औंला देखाउँदै हकार्नुभयो । पुरानो घटनालाई कोट्याउँदै ठूलै गल्ती गरेको जसरी बेस्करी कराउँदै भन्नुभयो, ‘तिमीहरूले सक्दैनौ भने छोडेर गए हुन्छ । मनोचिकित्सक बन्न लायक छनौं, तिमीमा मानवीय संवेदना पनि छैन ।’ अन्य कुनै पनि विषयमा पढ्न नपाएर फालिएर मनोचिकित्सा विभागमा आएको हो । डाक्टर भन्न पनि लायक नभएको सुन्न नसकिने खालका शब्दले गाली गर्नुभयो । त्यो घटनाले के गल्ती गरेँ र यस्तो शब्द सुन्नुपर्यो भनेर दिमागमा त्यही कुरा खेलिरह्यो । बिरामीको अगाडि नै गाली गर्न थालेपछि मलाई निकै अपमान महसुस भयो । त्यसै दिन दिउँसो १ बजे खाना खाने समयमा आत्महत्याको सोच आयो । १ बजे रुममा गएँ । घरमा फोन गरेर रुँदै यस्तो वातावरणमा पढ्न नसक्ने, बरु घरै फर्किने बताएँ । तर बुबाआमाले हतारमा निर्णय नगर भन्दै सम्झाउने कोसिस गर्नुभयो । त्यतिबेला आत्महत्या गरौं भन्ने सोच मनमा आइरहेको थियो । रुममा औषधि मात्रै फेला पारेँ । तर त्यति औषधिले मर्न सम्भव थिएन । दुई बजे ड्युटी सुरु भइहाल्ने थियो । त्यस दिन घटना मनमा खेलिरहँदा वार्डमा जान मन नै थिएन । बिहान डिस्चार्ज गर्न लागेको बिरामीको प्रक्रिया अगाडि बढाउनुपर्ने थियो । तर मलाई जान मन नै नलागेको कारण समकक्षीलाई डिस्चार्ज प्रक्रिया अगाडि बढाउन अनुरोध गरेँ । तर समकक्षीले डिस्चार्ज पेपर लिएर जाँदा डा. रियाले साइन गर्न नमानी उल्टै हप्काएर पठाउनुभएछ । २ बजे आकस्मिक कक्षबाट सिरियस केस आएको भन्दै फोन आयो । त्यसपछि म हतारहतार आकस्मिक कक्ष पुगेँ । त्यति नै बेला म्यामले साइन गर्न नमानेको र तिमीलाई नै बोलाएको समकक्षीले बताए । आकस्मिक कक्षमा सिरियस बिरामीलाई छोडेर म ओपीडी कक्ष पुगेँ । बिहानको घटनाले आत्महत्याको सोच विस्तारै हराएको थियो । तर, आकस्मिक कक्षमा जीवन र मरणको दोसाँधमा भएको बिरामीलाई हेर्न नपाउँदा मेरो मन कुँडियो र आत्महत्याको सोच झन् बलियो बन्यो । दिउँसो ४ बजेतिर राउन्ड सकेर ‘भोलि मेरो प्रिजेन्टेसन बनाउनु छ’ भन्दै कोठातिर लागेँ । निरन्तरको मानसिक यातनाले मलाई आत्महत्या गर्न सोच बलियो बनाउँदै लगेको थियो । कोठामा जानुअघि फार्मेसीबाट दुई पत्ता औषधि किनेँ । औषधि ३० ट्याबलेट थियो । रुममा अरु केही औषधि पनि बाँकी थियो । कोठा पुगेर मैले छिटोछिटो तीन–तीन वटा गर्दै ३० ट्याबलेट खाएँ । एउटा मनले आफूलाई केही भयो भने छोरीले दुःख पाउँछिन् भन्ने सोच पनि आइरहेको थियो । ३० वटा ट्याब्लेट खाइसकेपछि बेडमा सुतेँ । त्यसपछि भने डर लाग्ने थाल्यो । बिस्तारै साइड इफेक्ट (पेट दुख्ने, वाकवाकी लाग्ने) हुन थाल्यो । छटपटी हुन थालेपछि साथीहरूलाई मोबाइलबाटै मेसेज लेखेँ, ‘मैले गर्दा तिमीहरूले पनि गाली खानुपर्‍यो । अब म अध्ययन गर्न छोडिदिन्छु, मलाई माफ गरिदेऊ ।’ किनकि, हामीहरूले पहिलो वर्षमा अध्ययन गर्दा कसैले पनि नछोड्न र छोड्नुपरेको खण्डमा सबैले अध्ययन गर्न छोड्ने कसमसमेत खाएका थियौं । त्यही म्यासेजले हुनुपर्छ, साथीहरूको मनमा केही भयो कि भन्ने परेछ । केहीबेरमा साथीहरू मेरो कोठामा आइपुगे । केही साथीले ढोका ढक्ढक्याइरहे । धेरै कर गरेपछि मैले ढोका खोलेँ । आफूले औषधि सेवन गरेको बताएपछि साथीहरूले हतारहतार आकस्मिक कक्षमा लगेर भर्ना गरे । पछि आईसीयूमा राखेरसमेत उपचार गरियो । अहिले ठिक छु । तर यो घटनाले मानसिक रुपमा निकै तनाव भइरहेको छ । अब हाम्रो माग भनेको विभागमा कार्यरत चिकित्सकलाई सधैंको लागि हटाएर अर्को शिक्षक नियुक्त गर्नुपर्छ भन्ने हो । यस्तो वातावरणमा हामी अध्ययन गर्न सक्दैनौं । अनलाइनखबरमा आबद्ध चौलागाईं स्वास्थ्य विटमा कलम चलाउँछन् । खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित

भाग्यमानी आईजीपीले पाएको ६ महिना,"दीपक थापा यस्ता भाग्यमानी अधिकृत हुन्, जसले विवाहकै दिन इन्स्पेक्टरको परीक्षा पर्दा प्रहरी सपना नै त्यागेका थिए । तर, उनका लागि संयोग यसरी जुरेर आइदियो कि करीब तीन दशकपछि ६ महिनाभित्र संगठनमा फरक थिति बसाल्ने अवसर पाएका छन् । ४ चैत, काठमाडौं । नेपाल प्रहरीका नवनियुक्त प्रहरी महानिरीक्षक (आईजीपी) दीपक थापा यस्ता अधिकृत हुन्, जसले विवाहकै दिन इन्स्पेक्टरको लिखित परीक्षा परेपछि प्रहरी बन्ने सपना त्यागेका थिए । तर, स्थायी शिक्षकको जागिर छँदैछ भनेर इन्स्पेक्टरको परीक्षा छाडेका थापालाई भाग्यले यति साथ दियो कि सरकारले परीक्षा नै एक महिना पछाडि सारेको सूचना सार्वजनिक भयो । विवाह पछि उनले इन्स्पेक्टर बन्ने सपना त्यागेका थिए, बरु शाखा अधिकृतमा भिड्ने सोच बनाएका थिए । त्यही बेला हाल वरिष्ठ अधिवक्ता रहेका नमस कार्कीले उनलाई सूर्यविनायकको मिठाइ पसलमा परीक्षाको मिति नै सरेको जानकारी गराएको उनी सम्झन्छन् । कार्कीले पनि इन्स्पेक्टरमा आवेदन दिएका थिए । सुरुमा थापालाई विश्वासै लागेन । तर, जब गोरखापत्रमा पनि परीक्षा सरेको खबर देखे, त्यसपछि उनलाई आफ्नै लागि परीक्षा सरे जस्तै भयो । ‘मिठाइ पसल अझै त्यहीँ छ, त्यो दिन मैले आफूलाई एकदमै भाग्यमानी ठानेको थिएँ’, उनी सम्झन्छन् । त्यसबेला मनमोहन अधिकारी प्रधानमन्त्री थिए, केपी शर्मा ओली गृहमन्त्री । त्यो दिन के कारणले परीक्षा सर्‍यो उनलाई अहिलेसम्म थाहा छैन । तर, त्यही कारण इन्स्पेक्टर बन्ने अवसर पाएका थापा झण्डै तीन दशकपछि उही बेलाका गृहमन्त्री ओलीले नै नेतृत्व गरिरहेको मन्त्रिपरिषद्को निर्णयबाट संगठनको सर्वोच्च पदमा पुगेका छन् । नेपाल प्रहरीका धेरै उच्च अधिकृतहरू धार्मिक स्वभावका छन्, भाग्यमा विश्वास गर्छन् । थापा पनि अनौपचारिक संवादमा भन्थे, ‘निधारमा लेखेको छ भने सबै हुन्छ ।’ नभन्दै सोमबार त्यस्तै भयो । आईजीपी नियुक्तिको राजनीति जानकारहरूका अनुसार, प्रधानमन्त्री केपी शर्मा ओली तेस्रो वरीयतामा रहेका एआईजी टेक तामाङलाई आईजीपी बनाउन चाहन्थे । झापासँग जोडिएका एमाले नेताहरूले तामाङको पक्षमा तीब्र लबिङ गरेका थिए । त्यो समूहले एआईजी थापालाई माओवादी अध्यक्ष एवं पूर्वप्रधानमन्त्री पुष्पकमल दाहाल ‘प्रचण्ड’सँग जोडेर आईजीपी बनाउन नहुने मत राख्दै आएको थियो । तर, थापालाई सत्तारुढ नेपाली कांग्रेसको बलियो साथ रह्यो, वरीयतामा अगाडि रहनुको फाइदा स्वभाविक रूपमा उनलाई नै थियो । कांग्रेसका कतिपय नेताहरू सुदीप गिरीलाई नेतृत्वमा ल्याउनुपर्नेमा लबिङमा पनि थिए । तर, गिरीलाई अगाडि ल्याउँदा एमालेले तेस्रो वरीयतालाई प्रस्ताव गर्न सक्ने भन्दै कतिपयले थापाको पक्षमा लबिङ गरे । गिरी आफैं पनि पछिल्लो समय आईजीपी बन्न घरदैलो नगर्ने भन्दै प्रतिष्पर्धामा पछाडि बसेका थिए । त्यतिबेला एमालेभित्रकै अर्को एउटा समूह भने थापाकै पक्षमा थियो । खासगरी, केन्द्रीय अनुसन्धान ब्यूरो (सीआईबी) को नेतृत्वमा रहेर उनले शेरादरबारदेखि अन्य जति पनि अनुसन्धान गरे, त्यसबाट त्यो समूह उत्साहित भएको जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । यसरी थापाले ३१औं महानिरीक्षकमाबाजी मारेकाछन् । तर, नयाँ प्रहरी ऐन संसद्बाट पारित नभए अहिलेको व्यवस्था अनुसार उनी लामो समय आईजीपी हुन पाउने छैनन् । हालकै अवस्थामा उनको कार्यकाल करिब ६ महिना मात्र छ । जानकारहरू नवनियुक्त आईजीपी थापाको असली ‘भाग्य’ परीक्षा आगामी ६ महिनामा हुने बताउँछन् । छोटो समयमा उनले नेतृत्वमा रहेर कस्तो काम गर्छन्, त्यसले उनको सिंगो प्रहरी करिअरको मूल्यांकन गर्नेछ । त्यसो त संसद्मा पेश भएको प्रहरी विधेयक यो अवधिमा पारित भए उनको सेवाअवधि थप ६ महिना लम्बिनेछ । तर, यो अवधिमा ऐन पारित हुने सम्भावना कम भएको जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । किनकि, प्रहरी विधेयकलाई लिएर संगठनभित्र र बाहिर तीब्र आलोचना छ । अहिले संसद्‌मा पेश भएको विधेयक जस्ताको तस्तै पारित भए संगठनको कमाण्ड कर्मचारी संयन्त्रको हातमा जाने भन्दै अधिकृतहरूले असन्तुष्टि जनाइरहेका छन् । प्रस्तावित प्रहरी ऐनमा प्रहरीको परिचालन, नियन्त्रण, निर्देशन र सुपरिवेक्षण गर्ने अधिकार गृह मन्त्रालयलाई हुने भनिएको छ । जिल्लाको शान्ति, सुरक्षा तथा सुव्यवस्था, अपराधको रोकथाम र नियन्त्रण सम्बन्धी कार्यका सन्दर्भमा प्रहरी कर्मचारी प्रमुख जिल्ला अधिकारीको नियन्त्रण, निर्देशन तथा सुपरिवेक्षणमा रहने उल्लेख छ । परिचालन र नियन्त्रण पुलिसिङको आधारभूत विषय भएको भन्दै यो अधिकार मन्त्रालयका अधिकारीहरूलाई सुम्पिन नहुने मतसहित पूर्वप्रहरी उच्च अधिकृतहरूले समेत लबिङ गरिरहेका छन् । अपराध रोकथाम र नियन्त्रण सम्बन्धी अधिकार प्रमुख जिल्ला अधिकारीलाई समेत दिइएको विषयमा पनि उनीहरूको असन्तुष्टि छ । यस्तोमा प्रहरी विधेयक मस्यौदा गर्ने आन्तरिक कार्यदलको तत्कालीन संयोजक समेत रहेका थापालाई राजनीतिक नेतृत्वसँग जुधेर यसलाई सच्याउनुपर्ने चुनौती छ । प्रहरी प्रधान कार्यालयका उच्च अधिकृतहरूका अनुसार, यी प्रावधान संगठनले पठाएको खाकामा थिएनन्, पछि मन्त्रालयका अधिकारीहरूबाट थप भएर संसद्सम्म पुगेको हो । यस्तोमा थापाले सुरुमै आफूलाई महानिरीक्षक बनाउनेहरूसँग विधेयकको मामलामा फरक मत प्रस्तुत गर्नेपर्ने अवस्था रहेको जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । नयाँ थिति बसाल्ने चुनौती पछिल्लो समय प्रहरी महानिरीक्षक (आईजीपी) हरू प्रहरी संगठनका लागि नयाँ काम गर्नभन्दा बढी आफ्नो पद जोगाउनै दौडधुप गर्नुपरेको परिस्थिति छ । आफ्नै ब्याचमेटहरूलाई मिलाएर जान नसक्दा संगठनमा ध्रुवीकरण भएको निकट विगत छ । यस्तोमा नवनियुक्त आईजीपी थापालाई सोमबार रातिबाट अवकाशमा जान लागेका आईजीपी वसन्त कुँवरभन्दा फरक बन्नुपर्ने चुनौती छ । कुँवरको कार्यकालको लामो समय केही फरक गर्नेभन्दा बढी आफ्नो पद कसरी जोगाउने भन्नेमै सीमित भएको कतिपय प्रहरी अधिकृतहरू टिप्पणी गर्छन् । उनी नेतृत्वमा रहँदा सुरुमा आफैं नक्कलीभुटानी शरणार्थीको गम्भीर विवादमामुछिए, पछि गृहमन्त्रीले उनलाई बाइपास गरेर अरु अधिकृतहरूमार्फत संगठन चलाए । त्यसैले संगठनको कमाण्डलाई नक्सालस्थित प्रहरी हेडक्वार्टरबाट सिंहदरबारतिर सार्न नदिने चुनौती पनि थापासामू रहनेछ । नेपाल प्रहरीका पूर्वडीआईजी हेमन्त मल्लका अनुसार, विगतका आईजीपीहरूले संगठनका अधिकृतहरूको कतिपय आन्तरिक मामला सुधारमा ध्यान नदिँदा समस्याहरूका चाङ लागेर बसेका छन् । प्रहरीभित्र व्यावसायिक अनुसन्धान अधिकृतहरूले आफूलाई असुरक्षित महसुस गर्छन् । कोभर्ट अपरेशनमा खटिएकाहरू आफैं एम्बुसमा परेर जेलसम्म पुगेको विगत छ ।  अधिकृतहरूलाई अब्बल अनुसन्धान र पुलिसिङले मात्र आफूलाई अगाडि पुर्‍याउँदैन भन्ने पर्न पुगेको छ । यस्तोमा भर्खरै नियुक्त भएका प्रहरी निरीक्षकहरू समेत पोष्टिङका लागि राजनीतिक दलका नेताहरूसँग सम्बन्ध बनाउन थालेका छन् । कानुनतः प्रहरी उपरीक्षक (एसपी) सम्मको सरुवा गर्ने अधिकार प्रहरी महानिरीक्षकलाई छ । तर, व्यवहारतः इन्स्पेक्टरको सरुवा समेत आईजीपीले आफू खुसी गर्नसक्ने परिस्थिति नभएको प्रहरीकै अधिकृतहरू बताउँछन् । ‘यस्तो राजनीतीकरणको बीचमा थापालाई झन् धेरै चुनौतीहरू छन्’, मल्ल थप्छन् । पछिल्लो समय अपराधका प्रवृत्ति पनि फेरिएका छन् । साइबर अपराध र आर्टिफिसियल इन्टलिजेन्स (एआई) जोडिएका प्रकरणहरू सतहमा आइरहेका छन् । यस्तोमा प्रहरीलाई आधुनिक बनाउन थापाले केही पहल गर्न सके भने पनि उनको कार्यकाललाई सफल मान्नुपर्ने जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । प्रहरीका एक उच्च अधिकृत भन्छन्, ‘हुन त उहाँको मुख्य चुनौती भनेकै थोरै समय हुनु हो, तर, त्यसमा पनि केही फरक थिति बसाउने कोशिश गरेर जान सक्नुभयो भने साँच्चै भाग्यमानी मान्नुपर्छ ।’ पोखरेल अनलाइनखबरका लागि राष्ट्रिय

बताउँछन् । किनकि, प्रहरी विधेयकलाई लिएर संगठनभित्र र बाहिर तीब्र आलोचना छ । अहिले संसद्‌मा पेश भएको विधेयक जस्ताको तस्तै पारित भए संगठनको कमाण्ड कर्मचारी संयन्त्रको हातमा जाने भन्दै अधिकृतहरूले असन्तुष्टि जनाइरहेका छन् । प्रस्तावित प्रहरी ऐनमा प्रहरीको परिचालन, नियन्त्रण, निर्देशन र सुपरिवेक्षण गर्ने अधिकार गृह मन्त्रालयलाई हुने भनिएको छ । जिल्लाको शान्ति, सुरक्षा तथा सुव्यवस्था, अपराधको रोकथाम र नियन्त्रण सम्बन्धी कार्यका सन्दर्भमा प्रहरी कर्मचारी प्रमुख जिल्ला अधिकारीको नियन्त्रण, निर्देशन तथा सुपरिवेक्षणमा रहने उल्लेख छ । परिचालन र नियन्त्रण पुलिसिङको आधारभूत विषय भएको भन्दै यो अधिकार मन्त्रालयका अधिकारीहरूलाई सुम्पिन नहुने मतसहित पूर्वप्रहरी उच्च अधिकृतहरूले समेत लबिङ गरिरहेका छन् । अपराध रोकथाम र नियन्त्रण सम्बन्धी अधिकार प्रमुख जिल्ला अधिकारीलाई समेत दिइएको विषयमा पनि उनीहरूको असन्तुष्टि छ । यस्तोमा प्रहरी विधेयक मस्यौदा गर्ने आन्तरिक कार्यदलको तत्कालीन संयोजक समेत रहेका थापालाई राजनीतिक नेतृत्वसँग जुधेर यसलाई सच्याउनुपर्ने चुनौती छ । प्रहरी प्रधान कार्यालयका उच्च अधिकृतहरूका अनुसार, यी प्रावधान संगठनले पठाएको खाकामा थिएनन्, पछि मन्त्रालयका अधिकारीहरूबाट थप भएर संसद्सम्म पुगेको हो । यस्तोमा थापाले सुरुमै आफूलाई महानिरीक्षक बनाउनेहरूसँग विधेयकको मामलामा फरक मत प्रस्तुत गर्नेपर्ने अवस्था रहेको जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । नयाँ थिति बसाल्ने चुनौती पछिल्लो समय प्रहरी महानिरीक्षक (आईजीपी) हरू प्रहरी संगठनका लागि नयाँ काम गर्नभन्दा बढी आफ्नो पद जोगाउनै दौडधुप गर्नुपरेको परिस्थिति छ । आफ्नै ब्याचमेटहरूलाई मिलाएर जान नसक्दा संगठनमा ध्रुवीकरण भएको निकट विगत छ । यस्तोमा नवनियुक्त आईजीपी थापालाई सोमबार रातिबाट अवकाशमा जान लागेका आईजीपी वसन्त कुँवरभन्दा फरक बन्नुपर्ने चुनौती छ । कुँवरको कार्यकालको लामो समय केही फरक गर्नेभन्दा बढी आफ्नो पद कसरी जोगाउने भन्नेमै सीमित भएको कतिपय प्रहरी अधिकृतहरू टिप्पणी गर्छन् । उनी नेतृत्वमा रहँदा सुरुमा आफैं नक्कलीभुटानी शरणार्थीको गम्भीर विवादमामुछिए, पछि गृहमन्त्रीले उनलाई बाइपास गरेर अरु अधिकृतहरूमार्फत संगठन चलाए । त्यसैले संगठनको कमाण्डलाई नक्सालस्थित प्रहरी हेडक्वार्टरबाट सिंहदरबारतिर सार्न नदिने चुनौती पनि थापासामू रहनेछ । नेपाल प्रहरीका पूर्वडीआईजी हेमन्त मल्लका अनुसार, विगतका आईजीपीहरूले संगठनका अधिकृतहरूको कतिपय आन्तरिक मामला सुधारमा ध्यान नदिँदा समस्याहरूका चाङ लागेर बसेका छन् । प्रहरीभित्र व्यावसायिक अनुसन्धान अधिकृतहरूले आफूलाई असुरक्षित महसुस गर्छन् । कोभर्ट अपरेशनमा खटिएकाहरू आफैं एम्बुसमा परेर जेलसम्म पुगेको विगत छ ।  अधिकृतहरूलाई अब्बल अनुसन्धान र पुलिसिङले मात्र आफूलाई अगाडि पुर्‍याउँदैन भन्ने पर्न पुगेको छ । यस्तोमा भर्खरै नियुक्त भएका प्रहरी निरीक्षकहरू समेत पोष्टिङका लागि राजनीतिक दलका नेताहरूसँग सम्बन्ध बनाउन थालेका छन् । कानुनतः प्रहरी उपरीक्षक (एसपी) सम्मको सरुवा गर्ने अधिकार प्रहरी महानिरीक्षकलाई छ । तर, व्यवहारतः इन्स्पेक्टरको सरुवा समेत आईजीपीले आफू खुसी गर्नसक्ने परिस्थिति नभएको प्रहरीकै अधिकृतहरू बताउँछन् । ‘यस्तो राजनीतीकरणको बीचमा थापालाई झन् धेरै चुनौतीहरू छन्’, मल्ल थप्छन् । पछिल्लो समय अपराधका प्रवृत्ति पनि फेरिएका छन् । साइबर अपराध र आर्टिफिसियल इन्टलिजेन्स (एआई) जोडिएका प्रकरणहरू सतहमा आइरहेका छन् । यस्तोमा प्रहरीलाई आधुनिक बनाउन थापाले केही पहल गर्न सके भने पनि उनको कार्यकाललाई सफल मान्नुपर्ने जानकारहरू बताउँछन् । प्रहरीका एक उच्च अधिकृत भन्छन्, ‘हुन त उहाँको मुख्य चुनौती भनेकै थोरै समय हुनु हो, तर, त्यसमा पनि केही फरक थिति बसाउने कोशिश गरेर जान सक्नुभयो भने साँच्चै भाग्यमानी मान्नुपर्छ ।’ पोखरेल अनलाइनखबरका लागि राष्ट्रिय सुरक्षा एवं समसामयिक विषयमा रिपोर्टिङ गर्छन् । खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित

पहिलो दिनमै बहिष्कार भोग्यो राजावादी ‘जनआन्दोलन समिति’ ले,"पाका पञ्च नेता नवराज सुवेदीलाई अघि सार्दै घोषणा भएको राजा फर्काउने जनआन्दोलन समितिले पहिलो दिनमै स्थापित राजावादीहरूबाट चरम बहिष्कार र उपेक्षा बेहोरेको छ । ४ चैत, काठमाडौं । विगतमा वैकल्पिक राजनीतिको वकालत गर्दै मार्गपरिवर्तन गर्ने रवीन्द्र मिश्र, स्वतन्त्र राजावादी अभियान चलाउने केशरबहादुर विष्ट, मधेसको क्षेत्रीयतावादी राजनीति हुँदै एमाले निकट बनेका राजेश अहिराज, कोरोना भाइरस भगाउने मन्त्र निकालेका पूर्वप्राज्ञ जगमान गुरुङ, अनि सीके राउतले इलाम २ को उपचुनावमा समर्थन गरेका लिम्बुवान पहिचानवादी उम्मेदवार प्रेमदीप थाम्सुहाङ : यी सबै आफूसँग रहेको दाबी गर्दै राजा फर्काउने मोर्चाका संयोजक बने ८६ वर्षीय पञ्च नेता, नवराज सुवेदी । जनआन्दोलनपछि पुनर्स्थापित संसद्का जनप्रतिनिधिबाट निलम्बित, अनि जनताले चुनेको संविधानसभाबाट झन्डै शतप्रतिशत मतसहित नारायणहिटी दरबारबाट निस्काशित भएका थिए, पूर्वराजा ज्ञानेन्द्र शाह । तिनै शाहलाई संविधानसभाबाट बनेको संविधान खारेज गर्दै, अनि ०४७ को संविधान फेरि फर्काउने प्रयास सुरु भएको छ । यिनैमध्येको ठूलो अभियानजस्तो देखिनेगरी सोमबार दिउँसो पाँचपाने प्रतिबद्धतापत्र जारी भयो । त्यसक्रममा ‘राजसंस्था पुनर्स्थापनाका लागि संयुक्त जनआन्दोलन समिति’ का तर्फबाट संयोजक सुवेदीले तीन अलग अलग समिति घोषणा गरे । ११ सदस्यीय निर्देशक समितिमा अस्मिता भण्डारी, कमल थापा, दुर्गा प्रसाईं, पशुपतिशमशेर राणा, प्रकाशचन्द्र लोहनी, रवीन्द्र मिश्र, रमा सिंह, राजेन्द्र लिङ्देन, हरिबहादुर बस्नेत, केशरबहादुर विष्ट सदस्य रहेको घोषणा गरियो । यस समिति अन्तर्गत गठन हुने आन्दोलन परिचालन समितिको संयोजक धवलशमशेर राणा, अनि सल्लाहकारमा जगमान गुरुङ, बुद्धिराज बज्राचार्य, शास्त्रदत्त पन्त, राजेश अहिराज र खेमराज सेढाई छन् ।  तर समिति र सल्लाहकार समूह घोषणा गरिसक्दा नसक्दै विभिन्न नेताहरूले आफूहरूसँग सल्लाहै नगरी सदस्य राखिएको भन्दै आपत्ति जनाउन थाले । यसरी प्रतिवाद गर्नेमा राप्रपा अध्यक्ष राजेन्द्र लिङ्देन, राप्रपा नेपाल अध्यक्ष कमल थापा, राजावादी स्वतन्त्र मोर्चाका संयोजक केशरबहादुर विष्ट, सल्लाहकारराजेश अहिराजलगायत छन् । राजावादी तथा राष्ट्रवादी ब्रान्डमा आफूलाई चम्काउँदै आएका नेताहरूले नै यो ‘संयुक्त जनआन्दोलन समिति’मा नरहेको घोषणा गरेपछि पूर्वराजा ज्ञानेन्द्र फर्काउन घोषित अभियानको सुरुवाती उत्साहमा पक्कै फरक पर्न सक्ने देखिन्छ । यद्यपि, पञ्चायतमा धेरैपल्ट सत्तारोहण गरेका ८६ वर्षीय नेता सुवेदी एक्लैमा राजासहितको ‘प्रजातन्त्र’ फर्काउने आन्दोलन घोषणा गर्ने हिम्मत भने त्यसै आएको होइन । सुवेदीका पछाडि ढाल बनेर उभिएका छन्, दुर्गा प्रसाईं, जसको नाम युट्युब र टिकटकमा मात्रै होइन, बैंक तथा वित्तीय संस्थाहरूको कालोसूचीमा पनि भेटिन्छ । सोमबार काठमाडौंको डिल्लीबजारस्थित भोजनगृहमा उपस्थित सबैखाले सम्प्रदायका राजावादीहरूबीच प्रसाईंले खुलेआम घोषणा गरे, ‘नवराज सुवेदी दाईले सारथिको भूमिका खेल्नुहुन्छ, बाण चलाउने काम म गर्छु ।’ प्रसाईंले पूर्वराजा ज्ञानेन्द्रको मात्रै एकल पैरवी गरेनन्, बरु बैंकहरूबाट ‘सताइएका पीडित’ खराब ऋणीहरूको भावना छुटेको भन्दै आफ्नो वास्तविक मर्का राख्न बिर्सने कुरै थिएन । उनले भाषणमा राजाको मात्रै समस्याको कुरा गरेनन्, आफूजस्ता ‘जनता’ का पनि भावना राखे । तर नवराज सुवेदी, पशुपतिशमशेर राणा, प्रकाशचन्द्र लोहनी लगायत उपस्थित नेताहरूले उनको यो प्रसंगतर्फ ध्यान दिएनन् । पाँच पृष्ठ लामो वक्तव्यमा पनि यस्तो उल्लेख छैन । प्रसाईंले आफ्ना गैरकानुनी क्रियाकलापविरुद्ध रिपोर्टिङ गर्ने सञ्चार संस्थाका सञ्चालकविरुद्ध सोमबार पनि एकलट गाली बर्साए । उनको थप गाली गणतन्त्रका कारकहरूतिर मात्रै थिएन, राजतन्त्र माग्नेहरूतर्फ पनि बर्सियो । विगतमा पालैपालो प्रचण्ड र केपी ओलीसँग आफूले लाभको प्रयोजनका लागि उठबस गरेको प्रसंग सर्वथा उपेक्षा गर्दै प्रसाईले राप्रपा अध्यक्ष लिङ्देन र राप्रपा नेपाल अध्यक्ष कमल थापाविरुद्ध गणतन्त्रका मन्त्री बनेको भन्दै कटाक्ष गरे । उनले दुई नेताहरू राजाका पालामात्र मात्रै नभई गणतन्त्रमा समेत मन्त्री बन्न पुगेको, तर आफू निस्वार्थ रुपमा राजाका लागि लागिरहेको दाबी गरे ।  ‘मैले कहिल्यै (सत्ताको) स्वाद लिइनँ, स्वाद लिन पनि चाहिनँ,’ प्रसाईंले भने, ‘तर यहाँ त राजा देखाउने, धर्म देखाउने, संसदमा जाने, मन्त्री पड्काउने, दौरासुरुवाल लगाउने प्रवृत्ति आयो ।’ राजावादी अभियन्ताकेशरबहादुर विष्टले भने दलगत रुपमा आएका व्यक्तिहरूले चलाउने समितिमा आफू नबस्ने भनी नाम हटाउन माग गरे । विष्टको जवाफमा संयोजक सुवेदीले भने, ‘मैल निष्पक्ष हुनुपर्‍यो भनी विष्टजीले माग गर्नुभयो, म आजदेखि राप्रपाको साधारण सदस्य समेत रहिनँ । मेरो अन्तिम संकल्प भनेको हिन्दूराष्ट्र र राजसंस्था स्थापना हो । यस कमिटीलाई मेरो बुता, वर्गत र शरीरले भ्याएसम्म यसैमा समर्पित हुन्छु, कसैले शंका लिनु पर्दैन ।’ सुवेदीले अनलाइनखबरसँग कुरा गर्दै विष्ट, थापा लगायत नेताहरू आफूसँग आउने दाबी गरे । आफू सोमबार बिहानसम्म केन्द्रीय सदस्य रहेको दल राप्रपाका अध्यक्ष लिङ्देनसमेत आफ्नो सदस्य बनेर आउने दाबी गरे । तर आफूलाई नसोधी नवराज सुवेदीको राजावादी मोर्चामा राखिएको भन्दै राजेन्द्र लिङ्देन र कमल थापा दुवैले प्रतिवाद गरेका छन् । लिङ्देनले अनलाइनखबरसँग भने, ‘समिति निर्माण प्रक्रियाबारे मलाई कुनै जानकारी छैन । यस्तो एकलौटी पारामा गठन गरेपछि बस्ने कुरै आउँदैन । तर राजसंस्थाको पक्षमा हुने जुनसुकै अभियानमा राप्रपाको साथ सहयोग हुन्छ ।’ थापाले संवादका क्रममा भने, ‘समिति बनेको छ भनेर मलाई थाहा थिएन । यसरी गठन भएको समितिमा बस्ने कुरै आउँदैन ।’ यस्तै सल्लाहकार राजेश अहिराजले पनि आफूलाई नसोधी नाम राखिएको भन्दै आपत्ति जनाए ।  यसरी चिनिएका सम्बद्र्धनवादी नेताहरूबाट बहिष्कार, अनि आफ्नै सहकर्मी अभियन्ताबाट कार्यक्रमस्थलमै उपेक्षा भोग्नुपरेपछि १५ चैतबाट सुरु गर्ने भनिएको राजसंस्था तथा हिन्दुराष्ट्र स्थापना अभियान सुरुमा अलगथलगको शिकार बन्न पुगेको छ । नवीन समझदारीको प्रस्ताव अलपत्र वक्तव्यमा दलहरूलाई न्युनीकरण गरेर वा राजसंस्थालाई निषेध गरेर देशहित नहुने, बरु ०४७ को संविधानलाई आधार मानेर ‘नवीन समझदारी’ तर्फ अघि बढ्नुपर्ने लेखिएको छ । चौथो बुँदामा भनिएको छ, ‘०४७ को संविधानलाई आधार मानेर, ०७२ को संविधानका सकारात्मक प्रावधान समेट्दै प्रमुख राजनीतिक पक्षहरूबीच सर्वपक्षीय सम्मेलनमार्फत् देश शान्तिपूर्ण नवीन समझदारीमा जाओस् भन्ने राजावादी–राजसंस्थावादीको चाहना हो ।’ तर वक्तव्य जारी भइसकेपछि बोल्न मन्चमा गएका दुर्गा प्रसाईंले यस्तो नवीन समझदारीको कुनै औचित्य नरहेको भन्दै खारेज गरे । अपाच्य शब्दहरूको वर्षा गर्दै प्रसाईले भने, ‘देशमा शोषण, लुट मच्चाएर बसेकाहरूसँग केको नवीन समझदारी ? यिनलाई त लात हानेर लखेट्नुपर्छ । नवीन समझदारी भनेको अहिले राष्ट्रपति बसेको ठाउँमा राजा राख्ने हो ? यस्तो कदापि हुन सक्दैन । राजा भनेको राजा हो ।’  धेरैले नवराज सुवेदी निर्मल निवास अर्थात पूर्वराजा ज्ञानेन्द्रको इशारामा नेतृत्व लिन अघि सरेको बताए पनि सुवेदी स्वयंले त्यस्तो नरहेको बताएका छन् । ‘सरकारसँग मेरो कुरा नभएको निकै धेरै भयो,’ अनलाइनखबरसँग उनले भने, ‘यो त हामीले देशको आवश्यकताका आधारमा तय गरेको कार्यक्रम हो । उहाँका लागि भनेर गरेको होइन, राष्ट्रिय खाँचो हो । त्यसैले म यसका लागि म जीवनपर्यन्त लडिरहन्छु ।’ राजावादी थुप्रै नेताहरूले अनलाइनखबरसँगको अनौपचारिक संवादमा सुवेदीलाई राजनीतिक एजेन्डाका आधारमा नभई व्यक्तिहरूका स्वार्थहरुको ढाल बनाएर अघि सारिएको भन्दै यसले राजसंस्थाप्रतिको आम निष्ठालाई धूमिल मात्रै बनाउने जिकिर गरे । ‘बैंकबाट खाएको ऋण नतिर्ने, उल्टै सञ्चालकहरूमाथि आपराधिक धम्की दिने, अनि साम्प्रदायिक खलल पुर्‍याउने व्यक्तिहरूको स्वार्थका लागि किन कोही औजार बन्ने ?’ एक शीर्ष नेताले प्रश्न गरे, ‘बेथितिलाई प्रश्न गर्ने हो, भएको थिति बिगारेर राजसंस्था फर्काउन सकिँदैन ।’ तस्वीरहरू :

विवादै विवादमा बित्यो बसन्त समय,"नेपाली नागरिकलाई नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी बनाएर अमेरिका लैजाने मानव तस्करीदेखि सहकारी ठगी प्रकरणमा जोडिएका व्यक्तिको पैरवी गरेको आरोपसम्म कुँवरले खेप्नु पर्‍यो । ४ चैत, काठमाडौं । ३०औं प्रहरी महानिरीक्षक बसन्तबहादुर कुँवर करिब दुई वर्षे कार्यकाल पूरा गरी आज सोमबारबाट अनिवार्य अवकाशमा जाँदैछन् । विद्यमान प्रहरी नियमावली २०७१ मा उल्लेख भएको ३० वर्षे सेवा अवधिका कारण कुँवर ४ चैतको राति १२ बजेबाट अवकाशमा जानेछन् । दुई वर्ष करिब ८० हजार फौजको कमान्ड गर्दै देशको शान्ति सुरक्षाको जिम्मेवारी सम्हालेका कुँवरको कार्यकाल विवादरहित भने रहेन । आईजीको कमान्ड सम्हालेदेखि अवकाशको मुखसम्म आइपुग्दा उनी विवादै-विवादमा मुछिए । नेपाली नागरिकलाई नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी बनाएर अमेरिका लैजाने मानव तस्करीदेखि सहकारी ठगी प्रकरणमा जोडिएका व्यक्तिको पैरवी गरेको आरोपसम्म कुँवरले खेप्नु पर्‍यो । १२ चैत २०७९ मा गृह मन्त्रालयमा तत्कालीन गृहसचिव विनोदप्रकाश सिंहबाट उनले आईजीको दर्ज्यानी चिह्न लगाउँदै गर्दा नेपाली नागरिकलाई नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी बनाएर अमेरिका लैजाने भन्दै गरिएको ठूलो ठगीको अपरेसन सुरु भएको थियो । उक्त अपरेसन काठमाडौं उपत्यका अपराध अनुसन्धान कार्यालयको टोलीले सुरुवात गरेको थियो । अपरेसनबाट नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी काण्डको ‘नेक्सस’ आईजी कुँवरसम्म जोडिएका प्रकरणहरु बाहिरिए । कतिसम्म भने यो प्रकरणका नाइके केशव दुलाल र सानु भण्डारीसँग कुँवरले सम्पर्क र भेटघाट गरेका विवरणहरु समेत बाहिरिएका थिए । नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी प्रकरणका नाइके दुलालको मोबाइलबाट तत्कालीन गृहसचिव टेकनारायण पाण्डेसँग भएको भाइबर च्याट प्रहरीले फेला पारेको थियो । तत्कालीन गृहसचिव पाण्डेमार्फत नै गिरोहले कुँवरसँग एसएसपी भएका बेला भेट गरेको देखिएको थियो । दुलालले १० असार २०७९ मा पाण्डेलाई म्यासेज लेखेका थिए, ‘सर नमस्ते, डीआईजी बसन्त कुँवरसँग कुरा भयो हजुर ?’ त्यसपछि पाण्डेले ‘१२ बजेपछि जानु न’ भन्ने जवाफ फर्काएको विवरण समेत फेला परेको थियो । म्यासेजमै बसन्त सरलाई पनि फाइनान्सियल सपोर्ट हुन्छ भन्दा पनि हुन्छ भन्दै पाण्डेले म्यासेज पठाएको समेत भेटिएको थियो । काठमाडौं उपत्यका अपराध अनुसन्धान कार्यालयको प्रमुख रहँदाभुटानी प्रकरणका गिरोहसँग कुँवरको भेट भएको खुलेकोथियो । कुँवर अपराध अनुसन्धान कार्यालयको एसएसपी भएकै बेला १८ जेठ २०७९ मा यो प्रकरणको उजुरी उनकै कार्यालयमा परेको थियो । त्यसपछि पक्राउ परेका सानु भण्डारी र टंक गुरुङ गृहको दबाबमा केही घण्टामै छुटेको खुलेको थियो । यो प्रकरणपछि आईजी कुँवरलाई विवादमा ल्याउने अर्को प्रकरण सहकारी ठगी हो । १४ चैत २०८० मा कुँवरले सहकारी अनियमितामा तत्कालीन उपप्रधानमन्त्री तथा गृहमन्त्री रवि लामिछानेको संलग्नता नभेटिएको बताएका थिए । राज्य व्यवस्था तथा सुशासन समितिमा अनुसन्धान अधिकृतलाई समेत सँगै उभ्याएर उनले न्यायाधीश बन्दै रविलाई ‘क्लीन चिट’ दिएको आरोप लाग्यो । नेपाली कांग्रेसका सांसद दिलेन्द्र बडूले केही सहकारीको रकम ग्यालेक्सी टीभीमा गएको र त्यसमा रवि लामिछाने नामको व्यक्ति जोडिएको भन्दै प्रश्न गरेका थिए । जवाफ दिने क्रममा आईजी कुँवरले भनेका थिए, ‘ठाडो उजुरीको रुपमा जो इस्यू आयो, दर्ता भएको छ । तर अनुसन्धान गर्दा तथ्य-प्रमाण भेटिएन । कानुनको दायरामा पनि पर्ने अवस्था आएन ।’ उनले गृहमन्त्री रवितर्फ हेर्दै थपेका थिए, ‘अहिले सांकेतिक रुपमा रवि लामिछाने भन्ने भएको छ । त्यो विषयमा अहिलेसम्मको तथ्य-प्रमाणका आधारमा कुनै पनि आधार देखिँदैन ।’ आईजी बोलेको यो विषयले संसद्‌मा समेत प्रवेश पाएको थियो । यो प्रकरणमा आईजी कुँवरलाई समेत छानबिन गरेर कारबाही गनुपर्नेसम्म माग राष्ट्रिय प्रजातन्त्र पार्टी (राप्रपा)का अध्यक्ष राजेन्द्र लिङ्देन माग राखे । १८ माघ २०८१ को प्रतिनिधि सभा बैठकमा लिङ्दनेले प्रहरी प्रमुख कुँवरमाथि छानबिन नै हुनुपर्ने माग समेत गरे ।  यो विषयमा कुँवरले मिडियाले कुरा बंग्याएको दाबी गरेका छन् । त्यतिबेला आफूले ‘अहिलेसम्मको अनुसन्धान’बाट दोषी देखिँदैन भनेकोमा ‘अहिलेसम्मको अनुसन्धान’ भन्नेलाई काटेर बाँकी प्रसारण गरिएको उनको भनाइ छ । त्यतिबेला छानबिन प्रारम्भिक चरणमै रहेकाले रवि दोषी हो/होइन भन्न सक्ने अवस्था नरहेकाले ‘अहिलेसम्मको अनुसन्धानबाट’ भनेर आफूले बोलेको केही समयअघि कुँवरलेअनलाइनखरसँग बताएका थिए । कतिसम्म भने, आईजी कुँवरलाई सरकारकै बहालवाला सञ्चार मन्त्री पृथ्वीसुब्बा गुरुङले जिब्रो थुत्नेसम्मको अभिव्यक्ति दिए । सरकारका प्रवक्ता समेत रहेका मन्त्री गुरुङले १५ भदौ २०८१ मा पोखरामा पत्रकार भेट कार्यक्रममा बोल्दै आईजी कुँवरको जिब्रो थुत्नुपर्ने अभिव्यक्ति दिएका थिए । कुँवरले प्रहरी समायोजनसम्बन्धी कानुन आए मान्दिनँ भनेको आफूले सुनेको भन्दै मन्त्रीले आक्रोश व्यक्त गरेका थिए । देशका बहालवाला मन्त्रीले सञ्चार मन्त्रीले जिब्रो थुत्छु भन्दा ८० हजार फौजको कमान्डरले एउटा विज्ञप्ति समेत जारी नगरेर प्रहरीको शिर निहुर्‍याउनुपर्ने अवस्था बनाएको आरोप आईजी कुँवरमाथि छ । प्रहरी हेडक्वार्टरले यस विषयमा कुनै प्रतिक्रिया नजनाए पनि पूर्वआईजी संगठनले भने विज्ञप्ति निकालेर सञ्चार मन्त्रीले आईजीसँग माफी माग्नुपर्ने र सुरक्षा निकायका बारेमा बोल्दा सचेत रहनुपर्ने जनाएको थियो । यता, प्रहरी विधेयक संसद्‌मा पेश भएको छ । उक्त विधेयकमा प्रहरी प्रशासनभन्दा पनि कर्मचारी प्रशासन र गृह मन्त्रालय हाबी भएको गुनासो प्रहरी अधिकारीहरुले गरेका छन् । प्रहरी नेतृत्वले आफ्नो अडान प्रष्टसँग राख्न नसक्दा प्रहरीका यसअघिका अधिकार समेत खोसिने अवस्था आउन लागेको भन्दै पूर्वप्रहरीहरुले आपत्ति समेत जनाएका थिए । यसअघि नभएको व्यवस्था नेपाल प्रहरी परिचालन समेत गृह मन्त्रालयले गर्ने विधेयकमा उल्लेख छ । अपराध रोकथाम नियन्त्रण तथा निर्देशनमा समेत सीडीओ भूमिका रहने विधेयकमा उल्लेख छ । यसअघि भने सीडीओको क्षेत्राधिकार शान्ति सुरक्षाका मामलामा मात्रै थियो । अडान लिन नसकेको, बोल्दा चिप्लिएकोदेखि भुटानी प्रकरणमा मुछिएका व्यक्तिसँग भेट भएको विषयले विवादित बनेका कुँवरले शान्ति सुरक्षाका मामलामा सन्तोषजनक काम गरे पनि प्रहरीको सरुवा बढुवामा भने पुरानै प्रवृत्ति हाबी भयो । अर्कोतर्फ अन्तरजातिय विवाह गरेका जोडीलाई धरपकड गरेर पक्राउ गर्न भारतसम्म प्रहरी पठाएको भन्दै विवाद भयो । सडकदेखि संसदसम्म यो विषयले प्रवेश पायो । गृहमन्त्रीको निर्देशनमा आईजी कुँवरले प्रहरी परिचालन गरेर धरपकड गर्न लगाएको आरोपले अवकाशको मुखमा समेत उनलाई विवादित बनायो । आईजी भएदेखि विवादको भुमरीमा परेका कुँवर अवकाशको उत्तरार्धमा आउँदा समेत विवादको सिलसिला जारी रह्यो । १२ चैत २०७९ मा सिंहदरबारमा दर्ज्यानी चिह्न लगाएपछि आईजी कुँवरले आन्तरिक शुद्धीकरण आफ्नो भीष्म प्रतिज्ञा रहेको बताएका थिए । तर कारबाही गर्न भनेर तानेका र कारबाही सिफारिस भएका केही उच्च अधिकारीहरुको हकमा उनको यो बोलीको कुनै प्रभाव देखिएन । एआईजी, डीआईजीसम्मलाई तानेर करबाही गर्ने सार्वजनिक रुपमा बताए पनि भाषणमा मात्रै सीमित रह्यो । तल्लो दर्जाका प्रहरी अधिकारीहरु सानो गल्तीमा कारबाही हुँदा पनि कारबाहीकै लागि सिफारिस भएका जिल्ला एसपीहरुको हकमा पनि कुँवरको सक्रियता देखिएन । प्रहरीका सरुवा-बढुवा पनि विवादरहित बन्न सकेनन् । अवधि नपुग्दै बिना कारण जिल्ला प्रमुख एसपीहरुको जिम्मेवारी खोस्ने प्रवृत्तिको निरन्तरता कुँवरको पालामा पनि चल्यो । जबरजस्ती राजीनामा गर्न लगाएर एआईजीको फुली बाँड्ने काम हुँदा आईजी कुँवर त्यसको साक्षी बने । एआईजी पदलाई यति सस्तो बनाइयो कि, त्यसको कुनै औचित्य नभएको पुष्ट्याईं कुँवरको पालामा भयो । यस विषयमा एक पूर्वआईजीको टिप्पणी छ, ‘प्रहरीमा काम बिनाको पद एआईजी हो भन्ने पुष्टि भयो । यो प्रवृत्तिले भोलिका दिनमा एआईजीको पद बाँड्ने होइन, खारेज गर्ने अवस्था आउँछ ।’ कुँवरले नै जथाभावी सरुवा तथा काज नगर्ने भन्दै सरुवा मापदण्ड बनाएका थिए । ‘नेपाल प्रहरीको सरुवासम्बन्धी मापदण्ड २०७९’ गृहमन्त्रीस्तरीय निर्णयबाट २१ साउन २०८० मा स्वीकृत गर्दै कार्यान्वयमा ल्याइयो । उक्त मापदण्डअनुसार जिल्लाहरु ‘क’ देखि ‘ग’ वर्गसम्म छुट्याएर एसपीको इन्चार्ज दिने विषय उल्लेख भए । ‘क’ वर्गको नेतृत्व सम्हालेका एसपीलाई ‘ख’, ‘ग’ वर्गको जिल्लामा सरुवा गरिने मापदण्डमा उल्लेख छ । अर्कोतर्फ इन्चार्जबाट इन्चार्ज नै सरुवा नगर्ने उल्लेख छ । तर आफैंले बनाएको मापदण्डविपरीत आईजी कुँवरले एसपीको सरुवा निकाले । ७ कात्तिकमा मानव बेचबिखन अनुसन्धान ब्यूरोमा रहेका एसपी गौतम मिश्रलाई चितवन पठाइएको थियो । चितवनलाई ‘क’ वर्गको जिल्लामा राखिएको छ । ‘क’ वर्गको जिल्लाको कमान्ड सम्हालिरहेका उनै मिश्रलाई अहिले मापदण्डविपरीत ‘क’ वर्गकै अर्को जिल्ला पर्सामा पठाउने काम भयो । सुधारका केही प्रयास लामो सयमदेखि प्रयास गरिए पनि सफल हुन नसकेको स्टाफ कलेजको कोर्स कुँवरले आफ्नै पालामा प्रहरीमा लागू गरेका छन् । ‘ड्रिम प्रोजेक्ट’ रुपमा कुँवर आफ्नो कार्यकालयमा स्टाफ कलेज कोर्स लागू गर्न सफल भएका छन् । लामो गृहकार्यपछि २१ भदौमा प्रहरी एकेडेमी (राष्ट्रिय प्रहरी प्रशिक्षण प्रतिष्ठान) र त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालयबीच स्टाफ कलेजको रुपमामास्टर्स इन पुलिस साइन्स (एमपीएस)मा हस्ताक्षरभएको थियो ।  सिनियर प्रहरी अधिकृतहरूको वृत्तिविकास र नेतृत्व विकास कोर्षको रुपमा एमपीएस कार्यक्रम सुरु गरिएको आईजी कुँवरको भनाइ छ । ‘एमपीएसले रिसर्च, अनुसन्धान, रणनीति र योजना तर्जुमा गर्न सक्ने दक्ष जनशक्ति विकास भई नेपाल प्रहरीको आधुनिकीकरण तथा सांगठनिक सुदृढीकरणका क्षेत्रमा अपेक्षित लक्ष्य प्राप्त हुनेछ,’ कुँवरको भनाइ छ । स्टाफ कलेज पास नगरेका प्रहरी अधिकृत डीआईजी समेत बन्न नपाउने उल्लेख छ । जसकारण बढुवामा हुने चलखेल धेरै हदसम्म कम हुने विश्वास समेत लिइएको छ । २०७० सालमा इन्स्पेक्टरमा भर्ना भएको ब्याचबाट स्टाफ कलेज लागू हुने भएको छ । तल्लो दर्जाका प्रहरी परिचर, जवान, हवल्दारहरुका माग सम्बोधन हुने गरी १६ वर्षमैं पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था बनाउन खोजिएको छ । यसअघिका हरेकजसो आईजीले १६ वर्षमै पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था लागू गर्ने निरन्तर प्रयास गरे पनि असफल भएका थिए । प्रहरी हेडर्क्वाटरकै सक्रियता र सुझावमा नयाँ बन्ने ऐन (हाल संसद्‌मा रहेको विधेयक)मा १६ वर्षमै पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था राखिएको छ । उक्त विधेयक पारित भएको अवस्थामा तल्लो दर्जाका प्रहरीको माग सम्बोधन हुनेछ । यसअघि केही आईजीहरुलाई आर्थिक अनियमितताको आरोप लाग्दै मुद्दा चल्नेदेखि अख्तियार उजुरी पर्ने गरे पनि यो मामलामा भने कुँवर स्वच्छ देखिएको प्रहरी अधिकारीहरुकै बुझाइ छ । यसका साथै लागुऔषध नियन्त्रण तथा कारबाही, अपराध अनुसन्धानका पाटाहरु र दैनिक शान्ति सुरक्षाका विषयहरु इन्टरपोलको सहयोगमा व्यक्ति पक्राउ गर्ने विषयहरुमा भने कुँवरको कार्यकाल सन्तोषजनक रह्यो । कुँवरको पालामा ३१ जनाभन्दा बढीलाई इन्टरपोलमार्फत बाहिरी देशबाट पक्राउ गरेर नेपाल ल्याइएको थियो । अपराध अनुसन्धानकै लागि भनेर कुँवरको पालामा ९ करोड बढीको लागतमा एआई बेस बिजनेस इन्टेलिजेन्स टुल्स खरिद गरिएको छ । यसले अपराध अनुसन्धानमा थप सहजता ल्याउने प्रहरीको विश्वास छ । अधिकारी अनलाइनखबरका लागि सुरक्षा, अपराध विषयमा रिपोर्टिङ गर्छन् । खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित आक्रोशित","विवादै विवादमा बित्यो बसन्त समय नेपाली नागरिकलाई नक्कली भुटानी शरणार्थी

‘क’ वर्गको जिल्लामा राखिएको छ । ‘क’ वर्गको जिल्लाको कमान्ड सम्हालिरहेका उनै मिश्रलाई अहिले मापदण्डविपरीत ‘क’ वर्गकै अर्को जिल्ला पर्सामा पठाउने काम भयो । सुधारका केही प्रयास लामो सयमदेखि प्रयास गरिए पनि सफल हुन नसकेको स्टाफ कलेजको कोर्स कुँवरले आफ्नै पालामा प्रहरीमा लागू गरेका छन् । ‘ड्रिम प्रोजेक्ट’ रुपमा कुँवर आफ्नो कार्यकालयमा स्टाफ कलेज कोर्स लागू गर्न सफल भएका छन् । लामो गृहकार्यपछि २१ भदौमा प्रहरी एकेडेमी (राष्ट्रिय प्रहरी प्रशिक्षण प्रतिष्ठान) र त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालयबीच स्टाफ कलेजको रुपमामास्टर्स इन पुलिस साइन्स (एमपीएस)मा हस्ताक्षरभएको थियो ।  सिनियर प्रहरी अधिकृतहरूको वृत्तिविकास र नेतृत्व विकास कोर्षको रुपमा एमपीएस कार्यक्रम सुरु गरिएको आईजी कुँवरको भनाइ छ । ‘एमपीएसले रिसर्च, अनुसन्धान, रणनीति र योजना तर्जुमा गर्न सक्ने दक्ष जनशक्ति विकास भई नेपाल प्रहरीको आधुनिकीकरण तथा सांगठनिक सुदृढीकरणका क्षेत्रमा अपेक्षित लक्ष्य प्राप्त हुनेछ,’ कुँवरको भनाइ छ । स्टाफ कलेज पास नगरेका प्रहरी अधिकृत डीआईजी समेत बन्न नपाउने उल्लेख छ । जसकारण बढुवामा हुने चलखेल धेरै हदसम्म कम हुने विश्वास समेत लिइएको छ । २०७० सालमा इन्स्पेक्टरमा भर्ना भएको ब्याचबाट स्टाफ कलेज लागू हुने भएको छ । तल्लो दर्जाका प्रहरी परिचर, जवान, हवल्दारहरुका माग सम्बोधन हुने गरी १६ वर्षमैं पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था बनाउन खोजिएको छ । यसअघिका हरेकजसो आईजीले १६ वर्षमै पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था लागू गर्ने निरन्तर प्रयास गरे पनि असफल भएका थिए । प्रहरी हेडर्क्वाटरकै सक्रियता र सुझावमा नयाँ बन्ने ऐन (हाल संसद्‌मा रहेको विधेयक)मा १६ वर्षमै पेन्सन हुने व्यवस्था राखिएको छ । उक्त विधेयक पारित भएको अवस्थामा तल्लो दर्जाका प्रहरीको माग सम्बोधन हुनेछ । यसअघि केही आईजीहरुलाई आर्थिक अनियमितताको आरोप लाग्दै मुद्दा चल्नेदेखि अख्तियार उजुरी पर्ने गरे पनि यो मामलामा भने कुँवर स्वच्छ देखिएको प्रहरी अधिकारीहरुकै बुझाइ छ । यसका साथै लागुऔषध नियन्त्रण तथा कारबाही, अपराध अनुसन्धानका पाटाहरु र दैनिक शान्ति सुरक्षाका विषयहरु इन्टरपोलको सहयोगमा व्यक्ति पक्राउ गर्ने विषयहरुमा भने कुँवरको कार्यकाल सन्तोषजनक रह्यो । कुँवरको पालामा ३१ जनाभन्दा बढीलाई इन्टरपोलमार्फत बाहिरी देशबाट पक्राउ गरेर नेपाल ल्याइएको थियो । अपराध अनुसन्धानकै लागि भनेर कुँवरको पालामा ९ करोड बढीको लागतमा एआई बेस बिजनेस इन्टेलिजेन्स टुल्स खरिद गरिएको छ । यसले अपराध अनुसन्धानमा थप सहजता ल्याउने प्रहरीको विश्वास छ । अधिकारी अनलाइनखबरका लागि सुरक्षा, अपराध विषयमा रिपोर्टिङ गर्छन् । खुसी दुःखी अचम्मित उत्साहित
